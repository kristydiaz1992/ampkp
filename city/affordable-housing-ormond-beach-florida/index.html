      <h2>Ormond Beach voters will decide on Nov. 6 whether to continue a tax that provides funding for affordable housing</h2><p><br>Ormond Beach voters will decide on Nov. 6 whether to continue a tax that provides funding for affordable housing. The tax, which is levied on properties with a taxable value of more than $1 million, generates about $1.5 million annually.<br><br>The money is used to help fund the city’s Housing Trust Fund, which provides grants and loans for the development of affordable housing. The tax is set to expire in 2020, but if voters approve the extension, it will be collected through 2025.<br><br>Supporters of the tax say it is necessary to help address the city’s affordable housing crisis. They point to the fact that Ormond Beach’s population is growing, and that many of the new residents are living in poverty.<br><br>Opponents of the tax say it unfairly targets wealthy property owners. They also argue that the money could be better spent on other priorities, such as infrastructure or public safety.<br><br>The Ormond Beach City Commission has voted to place the extension on the ballot, and it will need to be approved by a simple majority of voters to take effect.<p><h2>The city of Ormond Beach is teaming up with a local non</h2><p>-profit to help keep the community's beaches clean. The Keep Our beaches Clean initiative will provide funding for the purchase of beach-cleaning equipment, as well as for educational programs to teach people about the importance of keeping our beaches clean.<br><br>Ormond Beach is partnering with the Keep Our Beaches Clean initiative to help improve the cleanliness of the city's beaches. The initiative provides funding for the purchase of beach-cleaning equipment, as well as for educational programs to teach people about the importance of keeping our beaches clean. This is a great way to help keep Ormond Beach's beaches clean and enjoyable for everyone.<p><h2>profit to provide more affordable housing</h2><p><br>There is no doubt that housing affordability is a major issue in many parts of the world. One way to help make housing more affordable is by providing more affordable housing options. By increasing the supply of affordable housing, we can help to make housing more affordable for everyone.<br><br>One way to increase the supply of affordable housing is by developing more affordable housing developments. These developments can be developed by private developers, non-profit organizations, or government agencies. By increasing the supply of affordable housing developments, we can help to make housing more affordable for everyone.<br><br>Another way to increase the supply of affordable housing is by providing incentives for developers to develop more affordable housing. These incentives can include tax breaks, government subsidies, or other financial incentives. By providing these incentives, we can encourage developers to build more affordable housing, which will help to make housing more affordable for everyone.<br><br>If we want to help make housing more affordable, we need to increase the supply of affordable housing. By increasing the supply of affordable housing, we can help to make housing more affordable for everyone.<p><h2>Ormond Beach leaders break ground on new affordable housing development</h2><p><br>Ormond Beach leaders joined together on Wednesday to break ground on a new affordable housing development.<br><br>The new development, located at 150 West Granada Boulevard, will feature 72 units of affordable housing for seniors and families.<br><br>Ormond Beach Mayor Ed Kelley said the development is an important step in providing quality affordable housing options for residents.<br><br>"This is a great day for Ormond Beach," Kelley said. "This development will provide quality affordable housing options for our seniors and families."<br><br>The development is being funded by the city of Ormond Beach, the Housing Trust Fund of Volusia County, and the Florida Housing Finance Corporation.<br><br>Construction is expected to be completed by fall 2020.<p><h2>Affordable housing advocates call on Ormond Beach to do more to address the issue</h2><p><br>There is a growing affordable housing crisis in Ormond Beach, and advocates are calling on the city to do more to address the issue. The median rent in Ormond Beach is now $1,500, and the median home price is $275,000. This is unaffordable for many residents, especially those on fixed incomes or low wages.<br><br>The city has taken some steps to address the issue, including creating an Affordable Housing Task Force and approving a $1 million fund to help develop affordable housing. However, advocates say that more needs to be done. They are calling on the city to create more incentives for developers to build affordable housing, and to make it easier for residents to access the existing affordable housing options.<br><br>Ormond Beach is not the only city facing an affordable housing crisis. Across the country, rents and home prices are rising faster than incomes, and this is putting a strain on families and individuals. However, Ormond Beach does have the opportunity to be a leader in addressing this issue, and to make life better for its residents.<p><h2>Ormond Beach City Commission votes to approve new affordable housing development</h2><p><br><br>The Ormond Beach City Commission recently voted to approve a new affordable housing development that will be built in the city. This is a great step forward for Ormond Beach, as affordable housing is an important issue for many residents. The new development will provide much-needed housing for families who may not be able to afford to live in Ormond Beach otherwise. This is a positive development for the city, and we hope to see more of these projects in the future.<p>
