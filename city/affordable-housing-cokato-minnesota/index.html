This would allow the city to maintain control over the development of affordable housing units, ensuring that they remain affordable in perpetuity.<br><br>5. Providing financial assistance to low- and moderate-income households to help with the down payment and/or monthly payments on a home. This could be done through a variety of programs, such as interest-free loans, grants, or subsidies.<br><br>6. Creating or expanding existing programs that provide rental assistance.
