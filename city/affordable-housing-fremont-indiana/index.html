For one, the city's population has been growing rapidly in recent years, while the amount of available housing has not kept pace. This has driven up rents and made it difficult for low- and moderate-income households to find affordable options.<br><br>In addition, Fremont is a largely rural community, which means that there is a limited amount of land available for new development. This lack of available land has made it difficult to build new housing developments that would help to increase the city's inventory of affordable units.<br><br>Finally, the median home value in Fremont is quite high, at $152,100. This is well out of reach for many households, especially those who are already struggling to make ends meet.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing in Fremont is a serious problem that is having a negative impact on the city's residents.
