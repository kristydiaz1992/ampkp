In 2016, they passed an ordinance that requires any new developments with 10 or more units to set aside 10% of those units for affordable housing. This has been a controversial ordinance, as some developers argue that it will make it too difficult to build new developments, and that it will lead to higher rents for everyone.<br><br>The city is also considering a bond issue to raise money for affordable housing. This would be a property tax increase, and would need to be approved by voters.<br><br>The issue of affordable housing is a complex one, and there is no easy solution. The city is taking steps to try to increase the amount of affordable housing, but it will take time to see if these steps are successful.<p>
