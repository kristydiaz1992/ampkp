The credit is administered by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and is available to both for-profit and non-profit developers.<br><br>The credit is intended to encourage the production of new rental housing for low- and moderate-income families. In order to receive the credit, developers must set aside a certain percentage of units for households that earn below a certain income limit. The credit is claimed over the course of ten years, and the value of the credit is based on the cost of construction and the number of units set aside for low-income households.<br><br>The LIHTC has been successful in incentivizing the production of new affordable housing units. From 1987 to 2013, the LIHTC generated over 2.8 million affordable rental units across the United States. The vast majority of these units are occupied by families with incomes below 60% of the area median income.<br><br>The LIHTC has been especially successful in Hercules, California. Since the city began participating in the program in 1995, over 1,700 units of affordable housing have been created. This has had a significant impact on the city, as the median rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Hercules is now $1,700, which is affordable for a family with an income at or below 60% of the area median income.<br><br>The city of Hercules has been a leader in the production of affordable housing, and the LIHTC has played a large role in that success. The city has used the credit to create a variety of different types of affordable housing, ranging from senior housing to apartments for families. The city has also been innovative in the way that it has used the credit, partnering with developers to create mixed-use projects that include both market-rate and affordable units.<br><br>The LIHTC has had a positive impact on the city of Hercules, and it is a key tool in the city's efforts to create more affordable housing.<p><h2>Workforce housing in Hercules</h2><p><br><br>There is a critical need for workforce housing in the City of Hercules. According to the Planning Department, over half of the households in Hercules are cost-burdened, meaning they spend more than 30% of their income on housing.<br><br>The City is committed to addressing this need and has taken several steps to create more workforce housing. In 2017, the City adopted an inclusionary housing ordinance that requires new residential developments to set aside a certain percentage of units for low- and moderate-income households. The City is also working on a density bonus program that would allow developers to build more units in exchange for including workforce housing.<br><br>These are important steps, but more needs to be done to create affordable housing for Hercules residents. The City is currently exploring ways to create a dedicated funding source for workforce housing. This could come from a variety of sources, such as a fee on new development or a tax on short-term rentals.<br><br>The City is also working with local employers to create employee housing programs. These programs would provide discounted or rent-free housing for employees who live and work in Hercules.<br><br>The City is committed to creating more workforce housing and is exploring a variety of options to make this happen. We encourage you to stay informed and participate in the process as we move forward.<p>
