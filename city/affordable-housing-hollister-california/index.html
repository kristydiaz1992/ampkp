      <h2>Housing crisis in Hollister</h2><p><br>Housing costs in Hollister have skyrocketed in recent years, leaving many residents struggling to keep up with the rising prices. The problem has been exacerbated by a lack of available housing, as the town's population has grown faster than its housing stock.

If something isn't done soon, the housing crisis in Hollister will only get worse, and more families will be forced into poverty or homelessness.<p><h2>How to find affordable housing in Hollister</h2><p><br>If you're looking for affordable housing in Hollister, there are a few things you can do to help you find what you're looking for.

This 42-unit complex is reserved for residents who earn 60% or less of the area median income. Other recent developments include the Oakwood Apartments (54 units for residents earning 50% or less of the AMI) and the San Vicente Apartments (40 units for residents earning 30% or less of the AMI).<br><br>The City of Hollister is also working on a new Inclusionary Housing Ordinance, which would require that all new residential developments include a certain percentage of units for low- and moderate-income residents.
