The city was established in 1836 by the Shreve Town Company, a group of businessmen led by Dr. Henry Miller Shreve, who navigated the Red River to open the area for American settlement. Caddo Parish was created in 1838, and Shreveport became its parish seat in 1839.<br><br>Shreveport soon became a center of steamboat commerce, carrying mostly cotton and agricultural crops from the plantations of Caddo Parish.

This could potentially help to offset the cost of construction, making it more feasible for developers to build these types of projects.<br><br>The city is also working on a new zoning ordinance that would create more opportunity for affordable housing developments. This ordinance is still in the early stages, but it has the potential to make a big difference in the availability of affordable housing in Shreveport.<br><br>It's clear that the issue of affordable housing is complex, and there is no easy solution.
