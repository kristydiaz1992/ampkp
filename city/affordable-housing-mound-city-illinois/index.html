The Atkins Diet limits carbohydrates to a very low level, and focuses on protein and fat as the main sources of calories.<br><br>Other popular low-carb diets include the South Beach Diet, the Zone Diet, and the Dukan Diet.<br><br>Low-carb diets have been shown to be effective for weight loss, and can also help to lower cholesterol and blood sugar levels. However, they can be difficult to stick to long-term, and some people may experience side effects such as headaches, fatigue, and constipation.<br><br>If you're thinking of trying a low-carb diet, it's important to speak to your doctor first to make sure it's the right choice for you.<p><h2>income housing options in Mound City, Illinois</h2><p><br>There are income-based housing options available in Mound City, Illinois.
