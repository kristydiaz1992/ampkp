      <h2> How Galt's affordable housing crisis is affecting residents</h2><p><br>Galt's affordable housing crisis is having a ripple effect throughout the city, as residents are being forced to move farther away from work, school, and other essential services. This is not only affecting low-income residents, but also middle-class families who are struggling to keep up with rising rents. The lack of affordable housing is also putting a strain on the city's infrastructure, as more people are moving into campgrounds and other makeshift housing arrangements.<br><br>The city of Galt is facing an affordable housing crisis that is affecting residents in a number of different ways. Low-income residents are being forced to move farther away from work and school, while middle-class families are struggling to keep up with rising rents.
