      <h2>The affordable housing crisis in Boyle Heights â€“ what can be done?</h2><p><br>The Boyle Heights community in Los Angeles is facing an affordable housing crisis. The median rent for an apartment in Boyle Heights is now $2,700, which is unaffordable for many residents. The average income in Boyle Heights is just $33,000, which means that many residents are spending more than 80% of their income on rent.<br><br>There are a number of factors that have contributed to the housing crisis in Boyle Heights. The area has experienced significant gentrification in recent years, as new businesses and restaurants have moved in. This has led to an increase in property values, and landlords have responded by raising rents.<br><br>There is also a lack of affordable housing developments in Boyle Heights. In 2016, only 3% of new housing units built in the city were designated as affordable for low-income households. This is down from 12% in 2015.<br><br>The housing crisis in Boyle Heights is having a devastating impact on the community. Families are being forced to move out of the area, and many are ending up homeless. The crisis is also contributing to rising crime rates, as families are forced to live in unsafe and overcrowded conditions.<br><br>So what can be done to address the affordable housing crisis in Boyle Heights?<br><br>One solution is to create more affordable housing developments in the area. This can be done by offering incentives to developers who agree to build units that are affordable for low- and moderate-income households.<br><br>Another solution is to increase the availability of Section 8 vouchers. Section 8 is a federal program that provides rental assistance to low-income households. However, there is currently a waiting list for Section 8 vouchers in Boyle Heights, and the waitlist is several years long.<br><br>The government can also help to address the affordable housing crisis by investing in public housing developments. Public housing developments are owned and operated by the government, and they provide affordable housing for low-income households.<br><br>Ultimately, the solution to the affordable housing crisis in Boyle Heights will require a combination of different approaches.
