First, it is important to note that many of the homes in affordable housing developments are located in areas that are geographically undesirable. This means that they are often located in areas that are prone to crime or that lack basic amenities. Additionally, affordable housing developments often do not have the same level of quality as more expensive housing developments. This can lead to problems with maintenance and safety. Finally, affordable housing can have a negative impact on property values in the surrounding area. This is because affordable housing developments are often associated with lower income families and thus can lead to decreases in home values.<p><h2> The Importance of Affordable Housing in Cedar Bluff</h2><p><br>Cedar Bluff is a growing community and the need for affordable housing is evident.

In Cedar Bluff, the median income for a family of four is $45,000 and the average rent for a two-bedroom apartment is $725. This means that a family would need to earn $2,275 per month to afford the average rent in Cedar Bluff.<br><br>There are many families in Cedar Bluff that do not earn enough to afford the average rent. These families are forced to either live in substandard housing or become homeless. Affordable housing is important because it provides families with a safe and clean place to live.

In 2017, the Town of Cedar Bluff approved a plan to build 40 new units of affordable housing. The units will be available to families that earn less than 60% of the median income.
