      <h2> The hidden costs of affordable housing in Malden, Missouri</h2><p><br>The Malden Housing Authority has been working hard to provide affordable housing options for low-income families in the city. However, there are hidden costs that come with these affordable housing options that families may not be aware of. <br><br>For example, many of the affordable housing units in Malden are located in high-crime areas. This means that families who live in these units are at a higher risk for crime. They may also have to pay for security measures, such as bars on the windows and doors, that they would not have to pay for if they lived in a safer area. <br><br>In addition, affordable housing units are often not well-maintained. This means that families who live in these units have to deal with repairs and maintenance issues that they would not have to deal with if they lived in a more expensive unit. <br><br>Finally, affordable housing units are often located in areas with poor schools. This means that families who live in these units may have to send their children to schools that are not as good as the schools in more affluent areas. <br><br>The hidden costs of affordable housing can be a burden for families who are already struggling to make ends meet. It is important for families to be aware of these costs before they move into an affordable housing unit.<p><h2> How to find affordable housing in Malden, Missouri</h2><p><br>There are many ways to find affordable housing in Malden, Missouri.
