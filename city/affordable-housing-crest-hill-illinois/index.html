      <h2>Crest Hill officials plan to increase affordable housing</h2><p><br>Crest Hill officials are planning to increase the number of affordable housing units in the village. The village currently has about 1,200 affordable housing units, but officials say they want to increase that number to 1,500.<br><br>Officials say they plan to do this by working with developers to create more affordable housing developments. They also say they will work with the Will County Housing Authority to provide more affordable housing opportunities for residents.<br><br>Crest Hill officials say they believe that increasing the number of affordable housing units will help to attract more families to the village. They say it will also help to improve the quality of life for residents who already live in the village.<p><h2>How Crest Hill is working to make housing more affordable for residents</h2><p><br>According to the latest Census data, the median rent in Crest Hill is $965, which is slightly lower than the national average of $1,045. The median income for Crest Hill residents is $61,542, which is also lower than the national average of $73,035.<br><br>Crest Hill is working to make housing more affordable for residents by partnering with local organizations to offer down payment assistance and other programs. The city is also working to increase the availability of affordable housing by approving new developments that include a mix of affordable and market-rate units.<br><br>One way Crest Hill is making housing more affordable is by partnering with the Will County Land Use Department to offer the Housing Choice Voucher program. The program provides down payment assistance for eligible residents who are looking to purchase a home.<br><br>Crest Hill is also working to increase the availability of affordable housing by approving new developments that include a mix of affordable and market-rate units. One such development is the Fairfield Ridge subdivision, which will include 33 single-family homes, half of which will be designated as affordable.<br><br>The city is also considering a proposal to create a Community Land Trust, which would help to preserve affordable housing in Crest Hill. The trust would be used to purchase and develop land for housing, which would then be leased to qualified buyers or renters at an affordable rate.<br><br>Crest Hill is committed to making housing more affordable for all residents, and these initiatives are a critical part of that effort.<p><h2>New affordable housing developments in Crest Hill</h2><p><br>There are a number of new affordable housing developments underway in Crest Hill. One of the most notable is the Crest Hill Commons, which will provide 108 units of affordable housing for families and individuals. The development is being financed through a mixture of Low Income Housing Tax Credits and private investment, and is expected to be completed in early 2019.<br><br>Other affordable housing developments in Crest Hill include the Silver Leaf Estates, which will provide 60 units of housing for seniors, and the Crest Hill Townhomes, which will provide 36 units of housing for families. Both of these developments are being financed through the Low Income Housing Tax Credit program and are expected to be completed in 2019.<br><br>With a number of new affordable housing developments underway, Crest Hill is poised to become a more affordable and accessible place to live for families and individuals of all incomes.<p><h2>Crest Hill alderman proposing new affordable housing ordinance</h2><p><br>A Crest Hill alderman is proposing a new ordinance that would create more affordable housing in the city.<br><br>The proposed ordinance would require developers to set aside a certain percentage of units in new developments for affordable housing. The percentage would be based on the number of units in the development, with larger developments required to set aside more units.<br><br>The ordinance would also create a fund to help pay for the construction of new affordable housing units. The fund would be financed through a mix of private donations and public funds.<br><br>The alderman believes that the ordinance would help to address the city's affordable housing crisis. Crest Hill has a growing population, but the number of available affordable housing units has not kept pace. This has led to rising rents and difficulty for low- and moderate-income residents to find housing.<br><br>The ordinance is still in the early stages of development, and it is not clear when or if it will be voted on by the City Council. However, the alderman is confident that it will eventually be approved and that it will make a positive impact on the city's housing situation.<p><h2>Crest Hill looks to increase affordable housing options</h2><p><br><br>The City of Crest Hill is looking to increase its affordable housing options for residents. The city council is considering a number of options, including creating a new housing authority or working with existing organizations. The goal is to provide more affordable housing for families, seniors, and other residents who may not be able to afford a traditional home. The city is also looking at ways to increase funding for affordable housing initiatives.<p>
