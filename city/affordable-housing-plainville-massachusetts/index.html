Let's debunk some of the most common ones:<br><br>1. Affordable housing is only for low-income people.<br><br>Wrong! Affordable housing is for anyone who cannot afford to pay market rent for a home. This includes people on low incomes, but also people on moderate incomes who may be struggling to make ends meet.<br><br>2. Affordable housing is only for people who are unemployed or on welfare.<br><br>Again, wrong! As above, affordable housing is for anyone who cannot afford to pay market rent for a home. This includes people who are working but not earning enough to cover the cost of rent.<br><br>3. Affordable housing is only for people who have bad credit or are in debt.<br><br>Nope! There are no credit checks or financial requirements for most affordable housing.<br><br>4. Affordable housing is only for people who are homeless.<br><br>No, affordable housing is for anyone who cannot afford to pay market rent for a home. This includes people who are homeless, but also people who are couch-surfing or living in substandard housing.<br><br>5. Affordable housing is only for people who are elderly or have a disability.<br><br>Wrong! Affordable housing is for anyone who cannot afford to pay market rent for a home. This includes people of all ages and abilities.<br><br>6. I don't need affordable housing, I'm doing just fine.<br><br>That's great! But affordable housing is not just for people who are struggling. It's for anyone who cannot afford to pay market rent for a home.<br><br>7. I don't want to live in affordable housing, it must be really run down.<br><br>Not necessarily! While some affordable housing may be in need of repair, there is a growing trend for new, high-quality affordable housing developments.<br><br>8. I don't want to live in affordable housing, I don't want to be around poor people.<br><br>This is a common misconception, but it's simply not true. Affordable housing developments are made up of people from all walks of life, just like any other neighbourhood.<br><br>9. I don't want to live in affordable housing, it must be really dangerous.<br><br>Again, this is a common misconception that is not based in reality. Affordable housing developments are just like any other neighbourhood, and the safety of residents is a top priority for landlords and property managers.<br><br>10. I can't afford to live in affordable housing, it must be really expensive.<br><br>Wrong! Affordable housing is, by definition, housing that is affordable to people on low and moderate incomes. This means that the rent is set at a level that people on these incomes can afford to pay.<p>
