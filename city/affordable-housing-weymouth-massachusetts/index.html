The median household income is $85,512 and the median home value is $329,200, which is quite high for the state. However, the cost of living in Weymouth is also high, with the average rent for a one-bedroom apartment costing $1,471.<br><br>Given the high cost of living in Weymouth, affordable housing is important for residents. Affordable housing means that people can live in a place without spending a large proportion of their income on housing costs. This is important because it allows people to have more money to spend on other things, such as food, clothing, and transportation.<br><br>There are a number of ways to make housing more affordable for residents. One way is to provide subsidies for renters or homeowners. Another way is to build more affordable housing developments. Weymouth has been working on both of these fronts in recent years.<br><br>In 2016, the town created a Housing Trust Fund to provide subsidies for renters and homeowners. The fund is funded by a surcharge on property taxes. In 2017, the town approved a plan to build 200 units of affordable housing on a vacant lot near the Weymouth Landing commuter rail station.<br><br>The town of Weymouth is taking steps to make housing more affordable for residents, and this is important for the community as a whole. Affordable housing helps people to live better lives and to participate more fully in the community.<p><h2> How to get involved in affordable housing initiatives in Weymouth</h2><p><br><br>There are a variety of affordable housing initiatives underway in Weymouth. The town has partnered with the South Shore Housing Development Corporation to create a new affordable housing development called the Weymouth Woods. This development will include 60 units of affordable housing for families and individuals. The town is also working with the Massachusetts Housing Partnership and the Weymouth Housing Authority to redevelop the Weymouth Heights housing complex. This redevelopment will create 100 units of affordable housing for seniors and families. Finally, the town is partnering with the Weymouth Community Development Corporation to create the Jackson Square Revitalization Project. This project will create 48 units of affordable housing for families and individuals.<p>
