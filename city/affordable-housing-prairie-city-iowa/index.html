This can drive up the cost of land, making it more difficult to create affordable housing options.<br><br>Another challenge is the lack of funding available for affordable housing projects. Many government programs that provide funding for these types of projects have been cut back in recent years, making it more difficult to get the money needed to build new housing. Additionally, private donors may be hesitant to invest in affordable housing in Prairie City due to the small size of the town.<br><br>It can also be difficult to find contractors and other workers willing to work on affordable housing projects.
