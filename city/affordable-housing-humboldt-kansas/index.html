This has led to a housing crisis, with many residents struggling to keep up with the rising cost of living.<br><br>One way to address this issue is to increase the availability of affordable housing. Affordable housing is housing that is priced below the market rate, making it accessible to low- and moderate-income households.<br><br>There are many benefits to increasing the availability of affordable housing. For one, it can help to reduce homelessness. According to the National Alliance to End Homelessness, nearly two-thirds of people who are homeless are also living in poverty. By increasing the availability of affordable housing, we can help to reduce the number of people who are homeless.<br><br>Affordable housing can also help to improve the quality of life for low- and moderate-income households.

Unfortunately, in many communities across the country, the cost of housing is rising faster than incomes, making it difficult for people to find safe, affordable homes.<br><br>The impact of this housing crisis is far-reaching. When people are struggling to pay their rent or mortgage, they have less money to spend on other essentials, like food and healthcare.

The crisis also affects businesses, as workers have less money to spend on goods and services.<br><br>The economy of Humboldt County, California, is particularly vulnerable to the effects of the housing crisis. The area is home to many low-wage workers, including those in the service and agriculture industries. The median rent in Humboldt County is $1,195, which is unaffordable for many residents.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing in Humboldt County has had a number of negative impacts on the local economy. For example, the homeless population in the county has increased by 33% since 2013. This increase has put a strain on local resources, like shelters and food banks.<br><br>The housing crisis has also made it difficult for businesses to attract and retain workers. Many workers are forced to commute long distances because they can't afford to live near their jobs. This makes it difficult for businesses to schedule shifts and can lead to higher turnover rates.<br><br>The effects of the housing crisis are far-reaching and have a significant impact on the economy of Humboldt County.

Businesses also suffer, as they have difficulty attracting and retaining workers.
