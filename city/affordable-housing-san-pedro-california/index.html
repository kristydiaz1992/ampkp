      <h2> How to find affordable housing in San Pedro</h2><p><br>Finding affordable housing in San Pedro can be a challenge, but there are a few ways to go about it. One way is to search for government-subsidized housing. These units are typically reserved for low-income individuals and families, and they often have lower rent prices. Another option is to look for housing developments that offer income-based pricing. This means that your rent price will be based on your income, making it more affordable for those who make less money. You can also search for apartments and houses that are available for rent through private landlords. These units may not be as affordable as government-subsidized or income-based housing, but they may be more affordable than other apartments and houses on the market. Finally, you can try to negotiate with your landlord for a lower rent price. This may be easier to do if you have a good rental history and can demonstrate that you are a responsible tenant.<p><h2> Different types of affordable housing in San Pedro</h2><p><br>There are many types of affordable housing in San Pedro. Below are a few examples:<br><br>1. Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC)<br><br>The Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) is a federal program that provides tax credits to developers of affordable housing projects for low-income households.

Public Housing<br><br>Public housing is affordable housing that is owned and operated by government agencies.

Project-Based Section 8<br><br>Project-based Section 8 is a federal program that provides subsidies to developers of affordable housing projects. Subsidies are provided for a specific number of units in the project, and tenants in those units must meet income requirements.<br><br>5.

This can lead to a decline in the local economy and a decrease in the tax base.<br><br>The City of Los Angeles is working to increase the supply of affordable housing in San Pedro. In 2016, the City approved the San Pedro Specific Plan, which includes a density bonus to encourage the development of affordable housing.
