      <h2> Lack of affordable housing in Palestine, Arkansas</h2><p><br>The cost of living in Palestine, Arkansas is relatively low when compared to other parts of the country. However, the availability of affordable housing is very limited.

This leaves a large number of residents struggling to find affordable places to live.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing is one of the biggest challenges facing the city of Palestine.

According to a report by the National Low Income Housing Coalition, there are only 24 affordable and available rental homes for every 100 extremely low income households in the state.

The number of homeless individuals in the city has grown by 20% since last year, and many of them are families with children. The lack of affordable housing is also putting a strain on the city's already limited resources, as shelters are struggling to keep up with the demand.<br><br>The city is working to address the problem, but it is a daunting task.

The median rent in Palestine is $650, which is also below the national median of $949.<br><br>There are very few apartments or homes available for rent in Palestine, and the ones that are available are often in poor condition.

Private investors are often reluctant to invest in rural areas because they perceive them to be risky. As a result, there is less money available to build new houses or to renovate existing ones.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing is a serious problem that is affecting many families in rural Arkansas. It is important that we find ways to address this problem so that families can have a place to call home.<p>
