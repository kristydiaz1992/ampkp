This has made it increasingly difficult for people to find affordable places to live.<br><br>One community that is feeling the squeeze is Granite Falls, Minnesota. The town has a median home price of $131,000, which is far above the national median of $85,000. And yet, the median household income in Granite Falls is just $37,000. This means that a typical family in Granite Falls would have to spend nearly four times their income just to buy a median-priced home.<br><br>Fortunately, there are a number of initiatives underway that could help make affordable housing more available in Granite Falls. One is the Granite Falls Housing Trust, which is working to develop and preserve affordable housing in the town.

This has led to a number of problems for the community, including an increase in homelessness and a decrease in the quality of life.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing in Granite Falls has had a negative impact on the community in a number of ways. First, it has led to an increase in homelessness. According to the Minnesota Department of Human Services, the number of homeless individuals in the town has more than doubled in the past five years.

For example, they may live in overcrowded apartments or houses, or they may be forced to live in homeless shelters. This can make it difficult for people to maintain a job or go to school, and it can also lead to mental health problems.<br><br>Finally, the lack of affordable housing in Granite Falls has also had a negative impact on the town's economy. This is because when people cannot afford housing, they are less likely to spend money in the community. This can lead to a decrease in sales at local businesses, and it can also lead to a decrease in property values. This can make it difficult for the town to attract new businesses and residents.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing in Granite Falls is a serious problem that is having a negative impact on the community in a number of ways.
