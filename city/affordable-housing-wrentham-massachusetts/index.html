      <h2>Wrentham residents call for more affordable housing</h2><p><br>As the town of Wrentham continues to grow, many residents are calling for more affordable housing options. While the town has seen an influx of new construction in recent years, much of it has been aimed at the higher-end market. This has led to concerns that Wrentham is becoming increasingly unaffordable for many residents, especially those who are looking to buy their first home.<br><br>There have been a number of townhomes and condo developments built in recent years, but they have generally been more expensive than what many first-time buyers can afford. There is also a lack of rental units available in town, which has made it difficult for people who are looking to rent to find a place to live.<br><br>The town does have a few affordable housing developments, but they are often full and have long waiting lists. This has led to calls for the town to do more to make sure that there are enough affordable housing options available for all residents.<br><br>One way that the town could make more affordable housing available is by working with developers to create more mixed-use developments that include both residential and commercial space. This would allow for more people to live in town while still being able to walk to shops, restaurants, and other businesses. It would also create more opportunities for people to work in town, which would help to keep the local economy strong.<br><br>The town could also create more incentives for developers to create affordable housing. This could include offering tax breaks or other financial incentives. It could also involve working with state and federal programs that provide funding for affordable housing projects.<br><br>Making sure that there is enough affordable housing available in Wrentham is important for the town's future. It is essential for keeping the town diverse and welcoming to all residents. It is also necessary for ensuring that the local economy remains strong. The town should continue to explore all options for creating more affordable housing so that everyone who wants to live in Wrentham can do so.<p><h2>Local officials break ground on new affordable housing development</h2><p><br>It was a momentous occasion as local officials, developers and community members gathered to break ground on a new affordable housing development. The new development, which is located in a rapidly gentrifying neighborhood, will provide much-needed affordable housing options for residents.<br><br>The development is a joint effort between the city, the state and a private developer, and will feature 100 units of affordable housing. The units will be reserved for residents who earn below 60 percent of the area median income.<br><br>The new development is part of the city's larger effort to increase the supply of affordable housing and to address the issue of gentrification. In addition to the new development, the city has also created a fund to help residents who are being displaced by gentrification.<br><br>The new development is a welcome addition to the neighborhood, and will help to ensure that residents of all income levels can continue to live in the area.<p><h2>Massachusetts governor proposes new affordable housing initiatives</h2><p><br>The state of Massachusetts is proposing new initiatives to make affordable housing more accessible to residents. The first initiative is a $1 billion investment to create more than 20,000 new affordable housing units across the state. The second initiative is a new program that would provide up to $150,000 in down payment assistance for first-time homebuyers. The goal of these initiatives is to make housing more affordable for residents of all income levels.<p><h2>New affordable housing complex opens in Wrentham</h2><p><br>The Wrentham Housing Authority and the town of Wrentham are excited to announce the opening of a new affordable housing complex in Wrentham! The complex, which is located on Washington Street, features 22 units of affordable housing for low- and moderate-income families.<br><br>The complex was built using a mix of private and public funding, including a grant from the Massachusetts Department of Housing and Community Development. The total cost of the project was $9 million.<br><br>The units in the complex are a mix of one-, two-, and three-bedroom apartments, and they are all income-restricted. The rent for a one-bedroom apartment starts at $850 per month, and the rent for a three-bedroom apartment starts at $1,050 per month.<br><br>The complex also features a community room, a laundry room, and on-site parking.<p><h2>Wrentham affordable housing lottery now open</h2><p><br><br>The Wrentham Housing Authority is now taking applications for its affordable housing lottery. The authority is offering five units at 30 Beech Street, with two units set aside for households earning up to 60 percent of the area median income, and three units for those earning up to 80 percent of the area median income.<br><br>To be eligible for the lottery, applicants must be first-time homebuyers, have a household income that does not exceed the income limits, and be able to obtain a mortgage. Applications are available online at the Wrentham Housing Authority website, and must be submitted by 4:00 p.m. on May 15, 2017.<br><br>For more information, please contact the Wrentham Housing Authority at (508) 384-5445.<p>
