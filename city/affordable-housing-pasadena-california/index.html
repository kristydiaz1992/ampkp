I hit the snooze button and try to get five more minutes of sleep. I’m exhausted. I didn’t get to bed until midnight because I was working the night shift. I’ve been working the night shift ever since I moved to Pasadena six months ago. I can’t afford to live anywhere else. I’m not from Pasadena originally. I’m from a small town in Ohio. I came out here for a fresh start. But so far, it’s just been hard.<br><br>I finally get out of bed and get ready for my day. I have to be at work by 7:00 a.m., so I don’t have much time. I eat a quick breakfast and then head out the door. I live in an affordable housing complex. It’s not the best, but it’s better than living on the streets. I can’t afford a car, so I have to take the bus to work.<br><br>I arrive at work and clock in. I work at a grocery store. It’s not my dream job, but it pays the bills. I stock shelves for eight hours. It’s hard work, but I’m used to it. I’ve been doing it for years. I take a quick lunch break and then it’s back to work.<br><br>I finish my shift at 3:00 p.m. and head home. I’m tired, but I have to keep going. I have to get dinner ready for my family. I have two kids. They’re both in school. I try to spend as much time with them as I can, but it’s hard.
