However, in recent years, these costs have become increasingly unaffordable for many residents, particularly those in the lower-income bracket. In fact, a recent report found that nearly half of all Delawareans are now considered "cost-burdened," meaning they spend more than 30% of their income on housing.<br><br>The problem is especially acute in the town of Smyrna, where the median home price has jumped to over $200,000 in recent years. This price tag is far out of reach for many residents, who are being forced to either spend a disproportionate amount of their income on housing or move to cheaper areas.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing is not only a problem for Smyrna residents, but for the town as a whole.
