      <h2>Lack of affordable housing in Pella forces residents to move away</h2><p><br>The lack of affordable housing in Pella is forcing residents to move away. The town has a long history of being a affordable place to live, but that is no longer the case. The median home price in Pella is now $250,000, which is out of reach for many residents. The town has a high cost of living, and rents have also increased. The average rent for a two-bedroom apartment is now $1,200.<br><br>There are few affordable housing options in Pella. The town has a limited number of apartments and duplexes, and most of them are already occupied. The town also has a few trailer parks, but they are often full. The only other option for residents is to live in a mobile home, but these are also becoming increasingly expensive.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing is causing residents to leave Pella. Many people are moving to neighboring towns, where the cost of living is lower. This is causing a decline in the town's population. The town is also losing businesses, as people are unable to afford to live in Pella and work in the town.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing is a major problem in Pella, and it is only getting worse. The town needs to find a way to provide affordable housing for its residents, or it will continue to lose them.<p><h2>Pella City Council approves affordable housing development</h2><p><br>The Pella City Council recently approved an affordable housing development that will bring much-needed homes to low- and moderate-income residents in the city. The development, called Pella Heights, will consist of 48 units of affordable housing, with a mix of one-, two-, and three-bedroom apartments.<br><br>The development is being funded by a combination of Low Income Housing Tax Credits, private investment, and a loan from the cityâ€™s Housing Trust Fund. The city is also providing a $50,000 grant to the developer, Pella Community Housing, to help with the costs of construction.<br><br>Pella Heights will be located on a vacant lot on the corner of Adams and Washington Streets, in a neighborhood that is already home to many low-income residents. The city is hoping that the development will help to revitalize the area, and that the new residents will be active members of the community.<br><br>The development is scheduled to begin construction in the spring of 2020, and should be completed by the end of the year.<p><h2>Affordable housing developers seek tax breaks from Pella City Council</h2><p><br>The Pella City Council is considering giving tax breaks to affordable housing developers. The council is considering a request from the developers to exempt them from paying property taxes for 10 years.<br><br>The developers say that the tax breaks would help them to build more affordable housing in the city. They say that the city needs more affordable housing, and that the tax breaks would help to make it more affordable.<br><br>The council is expected to make a decision on the request at their next meeting.<p><h2>Pella City Council voting on affordable housing moratorium</h2><p><br>The Pella City Council is voting on a moratorium on affordable housing. The moratorium would last for one year and would give the city time to study the issue and come up with a plan.<br><br>The council is divided on the issue, with some members saying that the moratorium is necessary to give the city time to come up with a plan, and others saying that it will just delay the inevitable.<br><br>The vote is expected to be close, and it is unclear how the council will vote.<p><h2>Pella residents rally for more affordable housing</h2><p><br>The Pella City Council has been debating a new ordinance that would require developers to set aside a certain amount of units for affordable housing. The ordinance would also create a new housing trust fund, which would be used to provide financial assistance for low- and moderate-income residents.<br><br>On Tuesday night, dozens of Pella residents gathered at City Hall to voice their support for the ordinance. Many of the speakers spoke about the difficulty of finding affordable housing in Pella, and the impact that has on families and individuals.<br><br>"We need more affordable housing in Pella. I know people who have had to move out of town because they can't find anything they can afford," said one speaker.<br><br>Another speaker spoke about how the lack of affordable housing can impact children. "I work at the elementary school, and I see kids coming to school tired because they've been moving around so much. They don't have a stable place to call home. This ordinance would help change that," she said.<br><br>The council is expected to vote on the ordinance at its next meeting. If it passes, Pella would become the first city in Iowa to require developers to set aside units for affordable housing.<p><h2>Pella community members speak out against lack of affordable housing</h2><p><br>There is a lack of affordable housing in Pella, and community members are speaking out about it. According to a recent study, the average rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Pella is $935, which is out of reach for many residents. The study also found that the vacancy rate for apartments in Pella is only 2.5%, meaning there are very few options for those looking for housing.<br><br>The community is calling on the city to do something about the lack of affordable housing, and they have created a task force to come up with solutions. The task force is currently looking at ways to create more affordable housing, such as increasing the number of units available, providing incentives for developers to build more affordable housing, and working with landlords to keep rent prices down.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing is a major problem in Pella, and it is one that needs to be addressed. The city is taking steps to try to solve the problem, but it will take time. In the meantime, community members are speaking out and trying to make a difference.<p><h2>Affordable housing task force meets in Pella</h2><p><br><br>The Pella City Councilâ€™s Affordable Housing Task Force met for the first time on Tuesday night to discuss the issue of housing affordability in the city.<br><br>The task force, which is made up of city council members, city staff, and community members, will be looking at ways to make housing more affordable for Pella residents.<br><br>Some of the ideas that were discussed at the meeting include creating a fund to help with down payments and closing costs, providing tax breaks for developers who build affordable housing, and working with landlords to create more affordable housing options.<br><br>The task force will meet again on Tuesday, October 15th at 5:30 pm in the Pella City Council Chambers.<p>
