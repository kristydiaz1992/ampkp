The city has been awarded grants and funding to help build new developments and support existing ones.

It is clear that this work is making a difference in the lives of Blackfoot families.<p><h2> The Impact of Affordable Housing on the Blackfoot Community</h2><p><br>There is a severe lack of affordable housing in the Blackfoot community. This has led to many families being forced to live in substandard housing, or even on the streets. This has had a negative impact on the health and wellbeing of Blackfoot members, as well as their ability to participate fully in the community.<br><br>Blackfoot members have long been disproportionately affected by poverty and homelessness. In recent years, the issue has become even more acute due to the rising cost of housing and the lack of affordable housing options in the community. As a result, many Blackfoot families are forced to live in overcrowded and rundown homes, or even on the streets.<br><br>This lack of adequate housing takes a toll on the health and wellbeing of Blackfoot members. Studies have shown that living in poverty and substandard housing is linked to higher rates of physical and mental health problems. This includes conditions such as anxiety, depression, and even heart disease. In addition, Blackfoot children who grow up in poverty are more likely to experience developmental delays and health problems.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing also affects the ability of Blackfoot members to participate fully in the community.
