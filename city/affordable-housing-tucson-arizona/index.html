Another benefit is that cohousing can provide residents with a greater sense of control over their living environment and the ability to live in a more sustainable way.<br><br>Cohousing can also be more affordable than other types of housing, due to the fact that residents often share resources and costs. For example, residents in a cohousing community may share a common kitchen and dining area, which can help to reduce the overall cost of living. Additionally, cohousing communities often have a strong focus on sustainability, which can help to reduce utility costs.<br><br>Of course, there are some challenges to cohousing as well, such as the fact that it requires a high level of commitment from residents.
