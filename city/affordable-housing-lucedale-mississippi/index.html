The city has responded by increasing its investment in affordable housing, but this has not always been successful.<br><br>The first affordable housing option in Lucedale was the development of public housing projects in the 1940s. These projects were designed to provide housing for low-income families, but they quickly became overcrowded and crime-ridden. The city began to look for other options for affordable housing in the 1950s.<br><br>One option that was explored was the use of government-subsidized private housing. This program provided financial assistance to developers who built housing that was affordable for low-income families. Unfortunately, this program was not very successful and was eventually discontinued.<br><br>The city continued to search for other ways to provide affordable housing options for its residents. In the 1970s, the city developed a community land trust. This trust allowed the city to purchase land that was then used to develop affordable housing. The trust was successful in providing affordable housing for many years, but it was eventually dissolved due to financial difficulties.<br><br>The city has also worked to create incentives for developers to build affordable housing. In the 1990s, the city created a tax abatement program that gave developers a break on their taxes if they built housing that was affordable for low-income families. This program has been successful in attracting new development and has resulted in the construction of several thousand new units of affordable housing.<br><br>The city has also taken steps to make sure that existing affordable housing is preserved. In the 2000s, the city passed a ordinance that requires developers to set aside a certain percentage of their units for low-income families. This ordinance has helped to preserve many existing units of affordable housing.<br><br>The issue of affordable housing is a complex one, and the city of Lucedale has a long history of trying to address it. The city has made some progress, but there is still more work to be done. The city continues to search for new and innovative ways to provide affordable housing options for its residents.<p>
