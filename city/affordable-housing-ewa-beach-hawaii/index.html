      <h2>Ways to make affordable housing more available in Ewa Beach</h2><p><br>There are many ways to make affordable housing more available in Ewa Beach. One way is to offer incentives to developers to build more affordable housing. Another way is to allow density bonuses so that developers can build more units on a given piece of land. Another way is to create special zoning districts that are reserved for affordable housing.<p><h2>The current state of affordable housing in Ewa Beach</h2><p><br>There is a critical shortage of affordable housing in Ewa Beach and the rest of Hawaii. The high cost of living in the state, combined with the limited availability of affordable housing, has created a perfect storm that is making it difficult for residents to find a place to live.<br><br>The median price for a home in Hawaii is now $730,000, which is out of reach for many residents. The average rental price in Honolulu is $2,500, which is also unaffordable for many people. As a result, many people are forced to live in overcrowded conditions or to move to another state where the cost of living is more reasonable.<br><br>The state of Hawaii has been working to address the affordable housing crisis, but there is still a long way to go. In 2016, the Hawaii Legislature passed a bill that appropriated $200 million for the construction of affordable housing units. However, this is just a drop in the bucket compared to what is needed to solve the problem.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing in Ewa Beach is having a negative impact on the local economy. Businesses are struggling to find employees because they cannot afford to pay them enough to live in the area. This is leading to a brain drain, as talented workers are leaving the state in search of better opportunities elsewhere.<br><br>The affordable housing crisis in Ewa Beach is not only affecting residents, it is also having a negative impact on the local economy. Businesses are struggling to find employees because they cannot afford to pay them enough to live in the area. This is leading to a brain drain, as talented workers are leaving the state in search of better opportunities elsewhere.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing is also putting a strain on the state's infrastructure. For example, the Honolulu International Airport is struggling to keep up with the demand for parking, as more and more people are living in their cars because they cannot afford to rent a place to live.<br><br>The state of Hawaii is working to address the affordable housing crisis, but there is still a long way to go.

The city is working on a plan to build more affordable housing, and they are also working with non-profit organizations to help provide housing for those who need it most. In the meantime, there are a few things that residents can do to help ease the burden.<br><br>One option is to look for housing outside of Ewa Beach.
