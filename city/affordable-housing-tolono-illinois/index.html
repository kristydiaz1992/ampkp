I was determined to make something of myself and break the cycle of poverty that my family had been stuck in for generations. I worked hard in school and got a good job after graduation. But no matter how hard I worked, I could never seem to get ahead. I was constantly living paycheck to paycheck, and the stress of it all was taking a toll on my health.<br><br>A few years ago, I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression. My doctor told me that I needed to find a way to reduce the stress in my life. That's when I decided to move back to Tolono. I figured that if I could find an affordable place to live, I could focus on my mental health and finally start to save some money.<br><br>I found an apartment in an affordable housing complex, and it has been a lifesaver. I'm able to pay my rent and still have money left over to cover my other expenses. I've been able to see a therapist regularly, and my mental health has improved drastically. I'm finally starting to feel like I'm getting ahead.<br><br>Living in an affordable housing complex has its challenges, but I'm grateful to have a place to call home. I'm surrounded by people who understand what I'm going through, and I know that I'm not alone. I'm slowly but surely building a life for myself, and I'm hopeful for the future.<p><h2> The history of affordable housing in Tolono, Illinois</h2><p><br>Tolono, Illinois is a village in Champaign County, Illinois, United States.
