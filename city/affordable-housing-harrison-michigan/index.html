In 2016, the average rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Harrisonburg was $875 per month, up from $795 in 2015 and $735 in 2014. This increase is far outpacing wage growth in the area, which has been stagnant for many workers.<br><br>There are a number of factors driving up housing costs in Harrisonburg. One is the influx of students attending James Madison University, which has seen its enrollment grow by nearly 5,000 students since 2010. With more students competing for off-campus housing, rents have spiked.<br><br>Another factor is the limited supply of affordable housing in Harrisonburg. In 2016, the city had just over 1,000 units of affordable housing available for rent, which is not enough to meet the needs of its low- and moderate-income residents. This shortage has been exacerbated by the recent demolition of several public housing complexes in the city.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing is having a detrimental impact on Harrisonburg's most vulnerable residents. Low-income families are being forced to spend a larger share of their income on housing, which leaves them less money for other basic needs like food and healthcare. This can lead to increased levels of stress and anxiety, and can even cause families to become homeless.<br><br>The city of Harrisonburg is working to address the affordable housing crisis, but it will take time and effort to make a dent in the problem. In the meantime, families who are struggling to find affordable housing should reach out to local organizations like the Harrisonburg Housing Authority for assistance.<p>
