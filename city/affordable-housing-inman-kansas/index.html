      <h2> Inman, Kansas: A Small Town with a Big Problem – Affordable Housing</h2><p><br>The town of Inman, Kansas is facing a big problem – affordable housing. The median home price in Inman is $131,000, which is far above the median income of $48,000. This means that many residents are struggling to find affordable places to live. <br><br>There are several factors that have contributed to the lack of affordable housing in Inman. The town has experienced a population boom in recent years, thanks to the opening of a new Walmart store. This has led to an increase in demand for housing, but the supply has not kept up. Additionally, many of the town's older homes are in need of repair or updating, making them unaffordable for many residents. <br><br>The town's leaders are aware of the problem and are working to find solutions. They have created a task force to study the issue and come up with recommendations. In the meantime, they are also working with local charities to provide assistance to residents who are struggling to pay their rent or mortgage. <br><br>The town of Inman is a great example of the challenges that many small towns are facing when it comes to affordable housing. However, it is also a town that is working to find solutions. With the help of its residents and leaders, Inman will be able to overcome this problem and continue to be a great place to call home.<p><h2> The Lack of Affordable Housing in Inman, Kansas is Hurting Families</h2><p><br>The lack of affordable housing in Inman, Kansas is hurting families. According to a recent report from the National Low Income Housing Coalition, the average rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Inman is $832, which is out of reach for many families. The report also found that there are only 22 affordable and available units for every 100 extremely low income renters in Inman. This lack of affordable housing is forcing families to choose between basic necessities like food and shelter.<br><br>Inman is not the only town in Kansas facing this issue. The report found that across the state, there are only 31 affordable and available units for every 100 extremely low income renters. This shortage of affordable housing is putting a strain on families and causing them to make difficult choices.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing is not just a problem in Kansas, it is a national issue. In 2016, there were only 35 affordable and available units for every 100 extremely low income renters nationwide. This shortage of affordable housing is having a negative impact on families across the country.<br><br>There are a number of factors that contribute to the lack of affordable housing. One of the most significant factors is the rising cost of rent. According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, the average rent for a two-bedroom apartment has increased by 3.2% since last year. This increase in rent is making it difficult for families to keep up with their housing costs.<br><br>Another factor that contributes to the lack of affordable housing is the lack of available units. The National Low Income Housing Coalition reports that there has been a decrease in the number of available units for extremely low income renters. This decrease is due to a number of factors, including the conversion of units into higher-priced rentals, the demolition of units, and the lack of new construction.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing is having a negative impact on families and communities across the country. It is time for our elected officials to take action and address this growing problem.<p><h2> Inman, Kansas: A Town in Need of More Affordable Housing</h2><p><br>Inman, Kansas is a town in need of more affordable housing. The town has a median home value of $95,700, and the cost of living is 8.5% higher than the national average. The median household income is $51,042, and the poverty rate is 15.3%. There are a limited number of rentals available, and the average rent for a two-bedroom apartment is $935. There is a high demand for housing, and the vacancy rate is only 1.5%.<br><br>There are many families who are struggling to find affordable housing in Inman. The town needs to find a way to provide more affordable housing for its residents. One option is to develop more affordable housing developments. Another option is to provide incentives for developers to build more affordable housing. The town could also work with nonprofit organizations to provide more affordable housing options.<br><br>Inman is a small town with a lot of potential. It is a great place to raise a family, and there are many good schools in the area. The town needs to find a way to provide more affordable housing so that more families can move to Inman and enjoy all that the town has to offer.<p><h2> How Inman, Kansas is Tackling the Affordable Housing Crisis</h2><p><br>The city of Inman, Kansas is tackling the affordable housing crisis by partnering with a local non-profit organization to provide affordable housing options for its residents. The city has committed to providing $1 million in funding to the organization, which will be used to build and operate an affordable housing complex.

The program will provide financial assistance to help residents pay their rent. The city is hoping that by providing these affordable housing options, it will be able to attract and retain families in the community.<p><h2> The Struggle to Find Affordable Housing in Inman, Kansas</h2><p><br><br>For many people in Inman, Kansas, finding affordable housing is a struggle. The town has a population of just over 1,000 people, and the median home price is $110,000. That's not a lot of money, especially when you consider that the median household income in Inman is only $37,000.<br><br>There are only a few apartment complexes in Inman, and they are all full. The waitlist for Section 8 housing is over a year long. And, there are very few houses for rent. So, what are people supposed to do?<br><br>Some people have been forced to move to neighboring towns. Others have been living in their cars or in tents. And, some people have been lucky enough to find friends or family who can help them out.<br><br>But, the struggle to find affordable housing in Inman is real. And, it's something that needs to be addressed.<p>
