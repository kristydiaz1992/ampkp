The population was 17,001 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Windham County. Windham is home to Eastern Connecticut State University.<br><br>Windham has a long history of affordable housing. The first affordable housing project in Windham was built in the early 1970s. Since then, the town has built several more affordable housing developments.<br><br>However, affordable housing in Windham is not without its challenges. One of the biggest challenges is the lack of accessible public transportation. Windham is not served by any major public transportation system, making it difficult for residents without a car to get around.<br><br>Another challenge is the lack of available jobs in Windham. Many of the jobs in Windham are low-paying, service sector jobs. There are few high-paying jobs available, which makes it difficult for residents to make ends meet.<br><br>Finally, affordable housing in Windham is often located in areas that are not desirable. Many of the affordable housing developments are located in areas that are far from shopping, dining, and other amenities. This can make it difficult for residents to lead a normal, comfortable life.<p><h2>What is the impact of affordable housing on the Windham community</h2><p><br>The impact of affordable housing on the Windham community is significant. According to a report by the National Low Income Housing Coalition, 60 percent of Windham residents are considered “cost burdened,” meaning they spend more than 30 percent of their income on housing. This leaves little room for other necessities like food, transportation, and healthcare.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing also puts a strain on the local economy. Businesses suffer when workers can’t afford to live nearby, and families are forced to move away in search of cheaper rent. This “brain drain” hurts the community in the long run, as skilled workers and talented students leave for greener pastures.<br><br>Fortunately, there are some initiatives in place to address the affordable housing crisis in Windham. The town has created a Housing Trust Fund to help finance the construction of new units, and the state has awarded grant money to help with the rehabilitation of existing homes. These efforts are a start, but more needs to be done to ensure that everyone in Windham has a safe and affordable place to call home.<p><h2>What are the different types of affordable housing in Windham</h2><p>?<br><br>There are many types of affordable housing in Windham.

In Windham, there are a number of public housing options available.<br><br>-Senior housing: This type of affordable housing is typically reserved for those who are 55 years of age or older.
