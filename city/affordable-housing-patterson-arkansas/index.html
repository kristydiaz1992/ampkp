The buildings are arranged in a U-shaped configuration and are surrounded by a landscaped courtyard. The development was designed by architect Clarence S. Stein and landscape architect Gilmore D.

The development was built by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and was managed by the New York City Housing Authority.<br><br>The Patterson Houses were originally racially segregated. The development was reserved for white families until 1955. In 1956, the development was opened to families of all races.<br><br>The Patterson Houses have been well-maintained and continue to provide affordable housing for families in need. The development is a key part of the Bronx's history and is an important part of the city's housing stock.<p><h2>Patterson Housing Voucher Program</h2><p><br><br>The Patterson Housing Voucher Program is a great way to help low-income families with housing costs.
