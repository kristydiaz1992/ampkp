The town was first settled in 1660 and was originally part of the town of Lancaster. In 1741, Bolton was incorporated as a separate town. For many years, the town was largely agricultural, with some small industry. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, however, Bolton began to experience significant growth, due in part to the arrival of the railroad. This growth led to a demand for housing, which was met in part by the construction of several large boarding houses.<br><br>The first affordable housing developments in Bolton were built in the 1930s, as part of the New Deal.

In the 1970s, however, the federal government began to withdraw its support for public housing, and the Bolton Housing Authority was forced to scale back its operations. As a result, many of the Authority's developments fell into disrepair.<br><br>In the early 21st century, the Bolton Housing Authority has begun to rebuild and revitalize its affordable housing developments. The Authority has also worked to create new affordable housing opportunities, such as the Bolton Senior Center and the Bolton Affordable Housing Trust.<br><br>The history of affordable housing in Bolton is one of ups and downs.
