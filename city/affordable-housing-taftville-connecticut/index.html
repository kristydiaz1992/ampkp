      <h2> The struggle to find affordable housing in Taftville</h2><p><br>There's no question that finding affordable housing in Taftville can be a struggle. With median home prices well above the national average, it's no wonder that many residents are forced to rent or live with family members.<br><br>One of the biggest challenges for those looking for housing in Taftville is the lack of available options. There are few apartment complexes and even fewer single-family homes for rent. This leaves many people scrambling to find a place to live that they can afford.<br><br>Another issue is that many of the available rental units are in poor condition. With little to no money for repairs, many tenants are forced to live in substandard housing. This can lead to health problems and other issues down the road.<br><br>The high cost of housing in Taftville is also a major burden for families. With so much of their income going towards rent, many residents are left with little to no money for other essentials like food and clothing. This can create a cycle of poverty that is difficult to break out of.<br><br>There are some programs and initiatives in place to help Taftville residents find affordable housing.

Many landlords are raising rents to sky-high levels, making it difficult for residents to keep up. This is especially true in areas where there is high demand for housing but a limited supply.<br><br>The third factor is the increasing cost of home ownership.
