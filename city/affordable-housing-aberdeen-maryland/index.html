      <h2>The city of Aberdeen is working to increase affordable housing options for its residents</h2><p><br>The city of Aberdeen is working to increase affordable housing options for its residents. The city has formed a task force to study the issue and make recommendations. The task force is made up of representatives from the city, county, and state government, as well as local housing advocates and developers. <br><br>The task force is currently exploring a number of options to increase the amount of affordable housing in Aberdeen. These options include:<br><br>-Making changes to zoning laws to allow for more density<br>-Creating a dedicated fund for affordable housing<br>-Working with developers to create mixed-income housing developments<br>-Providing incentives for developers to create more affordable housing<br><br>The city is hopeful that by working with developers and other stakeholders, they will be able to increase the amount of affordable housing options available to residents.<p><h2>Aberdeen officials are considering new strategies to address the city's affordable housing crisis</h2><p><br>Officials in Aberdeen, Washington are considering new strategies to address the city's affordable housing crisis. The crisis has been exacerbated by the city's rapid growth in recent years, as well as by the rising cost of living in the area.<br><br>Aberdeen's Mayor, Pete Schave, has formed a task force to study the issue and make recommendations. The task force is expected to release its report in the coming weeks. Among the options being considered are increasing the city's supply of affordable housing, providing financial assistance to low-income residents, and reforming the city's zoning laws.<br><br>The city's growth has put a strain on its housing market, and many residents are struggling to keep up with the rising cost of living. The median rent in Aberdeen has increased by nearly 20% in the past five years, and the median home price has more than doubled.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing is a serious problem for many low-income residents, who are often forced to spend a large portion of their income on housing. This can make it difficult to afford other basic necessities, such as food and transportation.<br><br>The city is hopeful that the task force's recommendations will help to address the affordable housing crisis and improve the quality of life for all of its residents.<p><h2>Aberdeen residents speak out about the need for more affordable housing options</h2><p><br>Aberdeen residents spoke out at a recent city council meeting, expressing their need for more affordable housing options in the city.<br><br>Aberdeen has a serious lack of affordable housing, and many residents are struggling to keep up with rent and mortgage payments. The city needs to do more to provide affordable housing options for its residents.<br><br>The city council is considering a few options to address the issue, but nothing has been decided yet. Aberdeen residents need to continue to speak out and demand more affordable housing options from their city government. Otherwise, the issue is not likely to be resolved anytime soon.<p><h2>Aberdeen businesses are feeling the squeeze as workers struggle to find affordable housing</h2><p><br>Aberdeen businesses are feeling the squeeze as workers struggle to find affordable housing. The city's workers are being forced to commute from surrounding areas, which is putting a strain on businesses. The lack of affordable housing is also making it difficult for businesses to attract and retain employees. Businesses are calling on the city to do more to address the housing crisis.<p><h2>A growing number of Aberdeen families are being forced to move because of the lack of affordable housing</h2><p>, a new report has found.<br><br>The number of households on the waiting list for a council or housing association property has increased by nearly a third in the last five years, while the number of social rented homes has fallen by 10%.<br><br>This has led to more families being forced to move into the private rented sector, where rents are often higher and conditions can be poorer.<br><br>The report, titled 'Housing Crisis in Aberdeen', was published by Aberdeenshire Council's housing and homelessness committee.<br><br>It found that the number of households on the waiting list for social housing has increased from 5,849 in 2013 to 7,703 in 2018.<br><br>During the same period, the number of social rented homes has fallen from 17,869 to 15,964.<br><br>The report said: "This increase in demand for social housing, coupled with a reduction in the supply of social housing, has put pressure on the ability of local authorities and housing associations to meet the needs of those on their waiting lists."<br><br>The report also found that the number of households in temporary accommodation has increased by 70% since 2013.<br><br>Aberdeen City Council leader Jenny Laing said the report made "grim reading".<br><br>She said: "The report shines a light on the growing problem of housing affordability in Aberdeen, which is increasingly forcing families into poverty and homelessness.<br><br>"The Scottish Government must take urgent action to address the housing crisis, and I would urge them to consider the recommendations of this report."<br><br>The report made a number of recommendations, including that the Scottish Government should increase investment in social housing, and that local authorities should do more to support families in the private rented sector.<p>
