The Waltons have been forced to live in their car for the past two months after they were evicted from their home. The family has been trying to find a new place to live, but the high cost of rent and the lack of available affordable housing options have made it difficult.<br><br>The Waltons are not alone in their struggle. The affordable housing crisis is affecting families across the country. According to a recent report from the National Low Income Housing Coalition, there are only 35 affordable and available rental homes for every 100 extremely low income renters.
