The median rent for a two-bedroom apartment is $1,300, and the median income for a household is $26,000. This means that many families are spending more than half of their income on housing.<br><br>The city has taken some steps to address this issue, such as approving a bond to build more affordable housing and creating a task force to study the issue. However, there is still more work to be done.<br><br>One of the biggest challenges is that there is not enough land available for new construction. The city is landlocked, and there is little available land for development. This means that any new construction is likely to be more expensive.<br><br>Another challenge is that the city is not zoned for high-density housing. This means that there are limits on how many units can be built on a given piece of land. This makes it difficult to build the type of housing that is most affordable.<br><br>The city is working on a number of solutions to these challenges. One is to create a community land trust. This would allow the city to purchase land and then lease it to developers at a reduced rate. This would make it easier for developers to build affordable housing.<br><br>The city is also working on a zoning change that would allow for more high-density housing. This would make it easier to build the type of housing that is most affordable.<br><br>The city is also working with nonprofits and other organizations to create more affordable housing. One example is the Thibodaux Housing Authority, which is working to create more affordable housing options for families.<br><br>The city is making progress on addressing the affordable housing crisis, but there is still more work to be done. By working on solutions such as the community land trust and the zoning change, the city can make progress in making Thibodaux a more affordable place to live.<p><h2> How the lack of affordable housing affects families in Thibodaux</h2><p><br>The lack of affordable housing in Thibodaux affects families in a number of ways.

This can make it difficult to afford other essentials, such as food and clothing.<br><br>Thibodaux is a city with a strong sense of community.
