      <h2>The city of Linn is working to make affordable housing a priority.</h2><p><br>Linn is a city in Oregon that is working to make affordable housing a priority. The city has a number of programs and initiatives in place to help residents find and maintain affordable housing. The city also offers a number of resources to help residents with their housing needs.<p><h2>Kansas lawmakers are considering legislation that would help make housing more affordable for families.</h2><p><br>Kansas lawmakers are considering legislation that would help make housing more affordable for families. The legislation would create a tax credit for developers who build or rehabilitate housing that is affordable for families. The credit would be worth up to 20 percent of the cost of the project. The legislation would also create a fund to help pay for the construction of affordable housing. The fund would be financed by a tax on real estate transactions.<p><h2>A new report finds that affordable housing is a top priority for Kansas families.</h2><p><br>According to the report, which was released by the nonprofit group Kansas Action for Children, nearly 60 percent of Kansas families said they would be willing to pay more in taxes to support affordable housing initiatives. The report also found that a majority of Kansas families are struggling to afford housing, with nearly two-thirds of respondents saying they are “cost-burdened” by their housing costs.<br><br>The findings of the report echo what advocates for affordable housing have been saying for years: that the lack of affordable housing is a major problem in Kansas, and one that is only getting worse. According to the report, the average rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Kansas has increased by nearly 20 percent since 2011, while median incomes have remained stagnant.<br><br>The report’s release comes as the Kansas Legislature is considering a number of bills that would address the affordable housing crisis. One bill, which is being sponsored by a bipartisan group of lawmakers, would create a new tax credit for developers who build or rehabilitate affordable housing units. Another bill would provide funding for a program that helps low-income families with their rent payments.<br><br>It’s clear from the Kansas Action for Children report that affordable housing is a top priority for Kansas families. Now it’s up to the Legislature to take action and pass some of the bills that are currently being considered.<p><h2>The state of Kansas is working to create more affordable housing options.</h2><p><br>The state of Kansas is working to create more affordable housing options. The state is allocating $20 million for the development of affordable housing, $5 million of which will go to the Kansas Housing Resources Corporation. The money will be used to create or preserve nearly 1,400 homes for low- and moderate-income Kansans. This is part of the state's larger goal to invest $500 million in affordable housing over the next five years. <br><br>The need for affordable housing is great in Kansas. According to the most recent data from the American Community Survey, nearly 14% of Kansans are living in poverty. And while the state's economy has been growing in recent years, wages have not kept pace. This has made it increasingly difficult for low- and moderate-income families to find safe and affordable housing. <br><br>The state's investment in affordable housing is a good first step, but more needs to be done to ensure that all Kansans have a place to call home.<p><h2>A new study finds that affordable housing is a top priority for Kansas families.</h2><p><br><br>Affordable housing is a top priority for Kansas families, according to a new study. The study, conducted by the Center for Housing Policy and the Kansas Housing Resources Corporation, found that nearly half of Kansas families are burdened by housing costs.<br><br>The study found that 47 percent of Kansas families are spending more than 30 percent of their income on housing costs, and 20 percent are spending more than 50 percent of their income. This leaves little room for other essentials, like food and transportation.<br><br>The study also found that minorities and low-income families are disproportionately burdened by housing costs. Fifty-six percent of black families and 53 percent of Hispanic families are spending more than 30 percent of their income on housing, compared to 46 percent of white families.<br><br>The findings of this study underscore the need for more affordable housing options in Kansas. With nearly half of all families struggling to keep up with housing costs, it is clear that the current system is not working. Families should not have to choose between a roof over their head and other essentials like food and transportation.<br><br>If you're interested in learning more about this issue, or if you're looking for ways to get involved, please contact the Kansas Housing Resources Corporation.<p>
