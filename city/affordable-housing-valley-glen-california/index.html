The average rent for a one-bedroom apartment in Valley Glen is now $2,000, and the waitlist for affordable housing is over two years long. With no end in sight to the housing crisis, what does the future hold for affordable housing in Valley Glen?<br><br>One option that is being increasingly considered is the construction of micro-apartments. These apartments are typically around 300 square feet, and often have a shared kitchen and bathroom. Micro-apartments are a popular option in Europe and Asia, and are now starting to gain traction in the United States.<br><br>While micro-apartments may be a viable option for some, they are not a panacea for the affordable housing crisis. For one, micro-apartments are still relatively expensive to build. Additionally, many people are unwilling to live in such close quarters with strangers.<br><br>Another option that is being considered is the construction of accessory dwelling units (ADUs). ADUs are small, secondary units that are built on the same property as a single-family home. They can be used as a rental unit, an in-law unit, or a home office.<br><br>ADUs are a more affordable option to build than traditional housing, and they offer more flexibility in terms of use. However, they are often opposed by homeowner associations and local governments.<br><br>The construction of both micro-apartments and ADUs will likely be controversial. However, given the dire state of affordable housing in Valley Glen, California, both options should be on the table.<p>
