      <h2>The Hollister, Missouri Housing Crisis</h2><p><br>The Hollister, Missouri housing crisis is a perfect example of what can happen when government officials fail to adequately plan for the future. In 2010, the city approved a development that would bring a Walmart Supercenter to the town. However, the city failed to consider the impact that this development would have on the housing market. As a result, the town is now facing a severe housing crisis.<br><br>The city of Hollister has a population of just over 2,000 people. However, the town is facing a housing crisis that is impacting families and individuals of all income levels. The average rent for a one-bedroom apartment in Hollister is now $1,100. For many families, this is simply not affordable.<br><br>The city has responded to the housing crisis by approving a moratorium on new development. However, this moratorium has not been without controversy. Some believe that the moratorium is a necessary step to allow the city to catch up on its planning. Others believe that the moratorium will only make the housing crisis worse.<br><br>At the end of the day, the Hollister, Missouri housing crisis is a perfect example of what can happen when government officials fail to adequately plan for the future.

This means that Hollister residents are spending more than half of their income on housing.<br><br>There are several factors that have contributed to the lack of affordable housing in Hollister.
