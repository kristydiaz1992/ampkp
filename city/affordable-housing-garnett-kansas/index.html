      <h2>Workforce development needed to address affordable housing crisis</h2><p><br>There is no question that the affordable housing crisis is one of the most pressing issues facing our country today. According to a recent report from the National Low Income Housing Coalition, there is a shortage of 7.2 million affordable homes for extremely low-income renters. This leaves millions of people, including families with children, seniors, people with disabilities, and veterans, struggling to find a safe and affordable place to call home.<br><br>One of the most effective ways to address the affordable housing crisis is through workforce development. By investing in programs that train and support workers in the construction and maintenance of affordable housing, we can create much-needed jobs and help build the quality, affordable homes our communities need.<br><br>Workforce development programs can help people of all ages and backgrounds enter into careers in the construction trades. Through on-the-job training, apprenticeships, and other educational opportunities, these programs provide workers with the skills they need to succeed in good-paying jobs. And, as the demand for affordable housing continues to grow, so too will the demand for workers skilled in its construction and maintenance.<br><br>In addition to creating jobs, workforce development programs can help to address the affordable housing crisis in another important way: by ensuring that the homes that are built are of high quality and will last for years to come. When workers are properly trained in construction and maintenance, they are more likely to build homes that meet code and are safe for families to live in.<br><br>The affordable housing crisis is a complex problem that will require a multi-faceted solution.

The task force has been working on a plan to create more affordable housing options in Garnett.<br><br>One of the task force's recommendations is to create a Community Land Trust. The trust would purchase land and then sell it to developers who agree to build affordable housing. The developers would be able to sell the units at an affordable price, and the trust would keep the land in perpetuity.<br><br>The task force is also working on a plan to create a Housing Choice Voucher program. The voucher program would help low-income residents pay for rent.<br><br>The city is also working on a plan to create an inclusionary zoning ordinance.

This can be done by creating more affordable housing options near public transportation, increasing the availability of affordable housing vouchers, and making it easier for people to qualify for affordable housing programs.<br><br>Third, we need to provide more support for people who are struggling to afford housing. This can be done by increasing funding for affordable housing programs, providing rental assistance, and increasing access to social services.<br><br>By taking these steps, we can start to address the affordable housing crisis in Garnett and make our community a more affordable place to live.<p>
