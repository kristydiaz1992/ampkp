In many cases, the time renters spend in their units is a good predictor of how long they will stay in the area. This is especially true for renters of affordable housing, who often have fewer options for finding new housing.<br><br>There are a number of factors that can influence the length of time a renter spends in their unit.

This can lead to problems down the road, as units that are not well-maintained can become uninhabitable.<br><br>Finally, the availability of other housing options can influence the length of time a renter spends in their unit. If there are few other options available, renters may feel trapped in their current situation and be less likely to move.

The stability of the housing market and the wellbeing of renters are both at stake.<p><h2> How to decorate your affordable housing unit on a budget</h2><p><br>If you're like most people, you probably don't have a lot of money to spend on decorating your affordable housing unit.
