      <h2>How to find affordable housing in Beverly, Massachusetts</h2><p><br>If you're looking for affordable housing in Beverly, Massachusetts, there are a few options available to you.

When people can’t afford their rent or mortgage, they may be forced to move into a shelter or live on the street.<br><br>Affordable housing is important for the economy as well.
