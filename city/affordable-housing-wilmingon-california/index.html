Local, state, and federal governments can all play a role in increasing funding for affordable housing initiatives.<br><br>4. Encourage accessory dwelling units<br><br>Accessory dwelling units (ADUs) are small living units that are attached to or located on the same property as a single-family home.

Third, the city needs to provide more support for low-income residents.<br><br>One way to increase the supply of affordable housing is to create more incentives for developers to build it. The city could do this by offering tax breaks or other financial incentives. Another way to increase the supply of affordable housing is to require that a certain percentage of units in new developments be set aside for low- and moderate-income residents.<br><br>One way to create more jobs that pay a living wage is to attract more businesses to the city. The city could do this by offering tax breaks or other financial incentives. Another way to create more jobs that pay a living wage is to require that businesses that receive city contracts pay their employees a living wage.<br><br>One way to provide more support for low-income residents is to increase funding for programs that provide assistance with rent, utilities, or other basic needs.
