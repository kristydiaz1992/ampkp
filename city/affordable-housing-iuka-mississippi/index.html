One is that there is simply not enough of it. The number of homes available for sale or rent is not keeping up with the number of people who need a place to live. This is especially true in desirable urban areas. Another reason is that the cost of building new housing has been rising faster than the cost of other goods and services. This is due to a variety of factors, such as the rising cost of land, construction materials, and labor.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing is a major problem that is affecting families and communities across the country. It is a complex problem with no easy solutions. But if we want to create an economy that works for everyone, we need to find ways to make housing more affordable.<p>
