      <h2>The Low</h2><p>down on Sodium<br><br>If you’re like most people, you probably think of sodium as the white powdery substance that makes up table salt. But sodium is actually a mineral that’s found in many foods, including meats, poultry, seafood, dairy products, and some vegetables. Sodium is an essential nutrient, but it’s important to consume it in moderation.<br><br>Too much sodium can lead to high blood pressure, which is a major risk factor for heart disease and stroke. The American Heart Association recommends consuming no more than 2,300 milligrams of sodium per day (about one teaspoon of salt). If you have high blood pressure, your doctor may recommend consuming even less sodium.<br><br>Most of the sodium we consume comes from processed and restaurant foods. To reduce your sodium intake, try cooking more meals at home using fresh ingredients. When you’re eating out, ask for your food to be prepared without salt. And when you’re grocery shopping, look for foods that are labeled “low sodium” or “no salt added.”<br><br>By making small changes to your diet, you can significantly reduce your sodium intake and improve your overall health.<p><h2>Income Housing Crisis in Milford, Nebraska</h2><p><br>Milford, Nebraska is facing an affordable housing crisis. The average rent for an apartment in Milford is $1,100, but the average income is only $26,000. This means that many residents are spending more than half of their income on housing. This is not sustainable and is causing many residents to fall behind on other bills and expenses.<br><br>The city is working on a plan to build more income-based housing, but the problem is complex and will take time to solve. In the meantime, residents can find assistance through the city's social services department and local charities.

This has led to a sharp increase in rent prices, and many families are struggling to find affordable places to live.<br><br>Another problem with affordable housing in Milford is the quality of the housing.
