Thankfully, there are still some affordable housing options available in Stockbridge.<br><br>One of the biggest benefits of affordable housing is that it allows families to live in safe and decent homes without having to spend a fortune. This is especially important for families with children, as a safe and decent home is essential for a child’s development.<br><br>Another benefit of affordable housing is that it can help to create a sense of community.
