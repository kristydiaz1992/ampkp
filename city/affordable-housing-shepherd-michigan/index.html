Low-cost airlines such as easyJet and Ryanair have been credited with driving down the cost of air travel, but they are not themselves "budget airlines".<br><br>The Low Cost Airline business model started in the 1970s with the success of Southwest Airlines in the United States. The key to the business model is the low fares and the elimination of many traditional passenger services, such as free meals and assigned seating.<br><br>The low-cost business model has been copied by many airlines around the world, and has led to the creation of a new category of airlines known as "low-cost carriers" (LCCs).<br><br>There are a number of reasons why airlines have been able to offer low fares:<br><br>1. Low Cost Carriers often have lower costs than traditional airlines. This is because they have simplified their operations and eliminated many traditional passenger services.<br><br>2. Low Cost Carriers often have a more efficient business model. This is because they have a no-frills approach and focus on selling tickets at low prices.<br><br>3. Low Cost Carriers often have a different business model than traditional airlines. This means that they are not as constrained by traditional airline regulations.<br><br>4. Low Cost Carriers often have a different cost structure than traditional airlines. This is because they have lower labor costs and often use less expensive airports.<br><br>5. Low Cost Carriers often have a different revenue model than traditional airlines. This is because they focus on selling tickets at low prices and often use ancillary revenue streams to generate profits.<br><br>The low-cost business model has allowed airlines to offer low fares and has made air travel more affordable for millions of people around the world.<p><h2>Income Housing in Shepherd, Michigan</h2><p><br>There is a great need for income housing in Shepherd, Michigan.
