      <h2>The cost of living in Peru, Indiana: Why affordable housing is a must.</h2><p><br>The cost of living in Peru, Indiana is relatively affordable compared to other parts of the country. The median home value in Peru is around $133,000, which is much lower than the national average of over $225,000. The median household income in Peru is also lower than the national average, at just over $41,000.<br><br>However, even though the cost of living in Peru may be relatively affordable, that doesn't mean that everyone can afford a comfortable lifestyle.

When businesses know that their employees can find affordable places to live, they are more likely to locate or expand to Peru. This can help to create jobs and grow the economy.<br><br>Finally, affordable housing is simply a quality of life issue. Everyone deserves to have a place to call home that they can afford.

The median home price in Peru is $69,900, which is much lower than the national average of $184,700. However, the median household income in Peru is only $37,771, which is much lower than the national average of $51,939. This means that a lot of families in Peru are spending a large percentage of their income on housing, and they are not able to save up for other things like retirement or college.<br><br>One of the main reasons why there is such a need for affordable housing in Peru is because the cost of living is very high. The average cost of a one-bedroom apartment in Peru is $725, which is much higher than the national average of $526.

The minimum wage in Peru is $7.25, which is lower than the national average of $7.50. This means that a lot of people in Peru are working multiple jobs just to try to make ends meet.<br><br>The city of Peru has been working on increasing the amount of affordable housing, and they have made some progress. However, there is still a long way to go. If you are interested in helping to improve the situation, there are a few things you can do.
