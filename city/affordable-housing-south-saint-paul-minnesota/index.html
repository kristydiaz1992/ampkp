There are a variety of housing options available, and the community is supportive and close-knit.

The median home value in South Saint Paul is $188,300, and the median rent is $959. The cost of living in South Saint Paul is lower than the national average, and the city has a higher than average rate of homeownership.<br><br>However, despite these statistics, the city faces a number of challenges when it comes to affordable housing. The first challenge is that there is not enough affordable housing available to meet the needs of the community. According to the Metropolitan Council, South Saint Paul has a “housing deficit” of 1,487 units. This means that there are not enough homes available for people who need them, and as a result, many people are forced to either pay more than they can afford or live in substandard housing.<br><br>The second challenge is that the city’s housing stock is older and in need of repair. According to the Metropolitan Council, South Saint Paul has a “deterioration rate” of 11.8%. This means that the city’s housing stock is deteriorating at a faster rate than the national average, and as a result, it is becoming increasingly difficult to find affordable housing that is in good condition.<br><br>The third challenge is that the city has a high poverty rate. According to the Metropolitan Council, the poverty rate in South Saint Paul is 18.5%. This means that a significant portion of the city’s population is living in poverty, and as a result, they are not able to afford the rising costs of housing.<br><br>The fourth challenge is that the city has a high crime rate. According to the Metropolitan Council, the crime rate in South Saint Paul is 4.5%. This means that the city’s crime rate is higher than the national average, and as a result, it is more difficult to find safe and affordable housing.<br><br>The fifth challenge is that the city’s public transportation system is not adequate. According to the Metropolitan Council, the city’s public transportation system only serves 12.5% of the city’s population. This means that a large portion of the city’s population does not have access to adequate public transportation, and as a result, they are not able to get to jobs or essential services.<br><br>Despite these challenges, the city is working to create more affordable housing. In 2017, the city adopted a comprehensive plan that included a goal of creating 3,000 new units of affordable housing by 2040. The city is also working to create new incentives for developers to build more affordable housing, and it is working to increase funding for affordable housing initiatives.<br><br>If you are interested in learning more about the challenges of affordable housing in South Saint Paul, or if you are interested in finding out more about the city’s efforts to create more affordable housing, you can contact the city’s Planning and Economic Development Department at (651) 554-3230.<p><h2>The future of affordable housing in South Saint Paul</h2><p><br><br>As the cost of living continues to rise, affordable housing is becoming increasingly difficult to find in South Saint Paul. According to a report from the National Low Income Housing Coalition, a family earning the median income in the city would need to earn nearly $17 an hour to afford a two-bedroom apartment.<br><br>The city has taken some steps to address the issue, including approving a new apartment complex that will offer units at below-market rates. However, with the need for affordable housing continuing to grow, more needs to be done to ensure that South Saint Paul remains a city that is accessible to all.<br><br>One way to make sure that there is enough affordable housing in the city is to create incentives for developers to build more units that are priced below the market rate. The city could also invest in more affordable housing developments itself.<br><br>Another way to ensure that there is enough affordable housing is to make it easier for people to build accessory dwelling units, such as mother-in-law apartments or granny flats. These units can provide much-needed housing at a fraction of the cost of a traditional apartment.<br><br>The city should also work to ensure that all of its residents have access to quality, affordable housing. This means creating incentives for landlords to accept tenants with low incomes, and working with non-profit organizations to provide support for those who are struggling to find housing.<br><br>By taking these steps, South Saint Paul can ensure that its residents have access to quality, affordable housing for years to come.<p>
