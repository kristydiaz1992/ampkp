Some people believe that affordable housing developments are a good thing, while others believe that they are a burden on taxpayers.<br><br>There is no doubt that the lack of affordable housing is a major problem in our country. According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, a household is considered “cost-burdened” if it spends more than 30 percent of its income on housing. This includes rent or mortgage payments, as well as utilities.<br><br>In Isanti County, the median household income is $76,385. This means that a family of four earning the median income would be considered cost-burdened if they spent more than $2,291 per month on housing.<br><br>Unfortunately, the cost of housing in Isanti County has been rising faster than incomes. The median rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Isanti County is $1,095, which is up 4.3 percent from last year. The median home price in the county is $239,900, which is up 8.5 percent from last year.<br><br>This means that more and more families are struggling to afford housing. In fact, the number of cost-burdened households in Isanti County has increased by 21 percent since 2011.<br><br>There are a number of reasons why housing costs have been rising faster than incomes. One is that there has been a decrease in the supply of affordable housing. This is due to a number of factors, including the fact that more families are moving to the county (which increases demand) and the fact that the number of new housing units being built has not kept pace with population growth.<br><br>Another reason why housing costs have been rising is that the cost of building new housing has gone up. This is due to a number of factors, including the rising cost of land, the rising cost of labor, and the rising cost of materials.<br><br>One way to help address the affordable housing crisis in Isanti County is to encourage the development of more affordable housing developments. These are developments that are specifically designed to provide housing for families who are struggling to afford housing.<br><br>There are a number of ways to do this. One is for the county to offer incentives to developers who build affordable housing developments. This could include offering reduced impact fees or offering property tax breaks.<br><br>Another way to encourage the development of affordable housing developments is for the county to zone for more density. This would allow for more units to be built on a given piece of land, which would make it more feasible for developers to build affordable housing developments.<br><br>The development of affordable housing developments is not a silver bullet. However, it is one way to help address the affordable housing crisis in Isanti County.<p>
