      <h2>Affordable Housing Initiatives in Culver City</h2><p><br>Culver City has long been a desirable place to live, due in part to its convenient location and strong sense of community. In recent years, however, the city has become increasingly unaffordable for many residents, as housing costs have skyrocketed.
