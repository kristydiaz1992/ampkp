      <h2>Affordable Housing Initiatives in Culver City</h2><p><br>Culver City has long been a desirable place to live, due in part to its convenient location and strong sense of community. In recent years, however, the city has become increasingly unaffordable for many residents, as housing costs have skyrocketed.

The trust has already helped dozens of families achieve their homeownership dreams, and it is hoped that it will continue to do so for many years to come.<br><br>Another initiative is the cityâ€™s inclusionary housing ordinance, which requires that all new developments set aside a certain percentage of units for low- and moderate-income households.
