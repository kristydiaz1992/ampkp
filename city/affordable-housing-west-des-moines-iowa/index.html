      <h2>The Affordable Housing Crisis in West Des Moines, Iowa</h2><p><br>There is no doubt that the affordable housing crisis is affecting many communities across the country. West Des Moines, Iowa is no exception. The city has seen a dramatic increase in rents and home prices in recent years, while wages have remained relatively stagnant.

There are very few apartments or homes available for rent that are affordable for working families. This has led to an increase in homelessness, as people are forced to live in their cars or on the streets.<br><br>The city of West Des Moines has taken some steps to address the affordable housing crisis, but more needs to be done. The city has created a task force to study the issue and make recommendations. It has also provided funding for a new homeless shelter. However, these steps are only a start.
