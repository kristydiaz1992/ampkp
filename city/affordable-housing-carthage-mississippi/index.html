      <h2> The current state of affordable housing in Carthage, Mississippi</h2><p><br>The current state of affordable housing in Carthage, Mississippi is abysmal. According to the most recent data from the U.S. Census Bureau, over 50% of households in Carthage are considered to be "cost burdened," meaning they spend more than 30% of their income on housing costs. This is one of the highest rates in the country.<br><br>There are a number of factors that have contributed to the high cost of housing in Carthage. The first is the lack of available units. According to the Mississippi Housing Partnership, there is a shortage of over 1,000 affordable housing units in Leake County, where Carthage is located. This shortage has driven up prices and made it difficult for low-income residents to find safe and affordable places to live.<br><br>Another factor that has contributed to the high cost of housing in Carthage is the lack of investment in the city's housing stock. According to the Leake County Economic Development Foundation, only 3% of the city's housing units have been built or renovated in the past 10 years. This has led to a decline in the quality of housing in Carthage, which has further driven up prices.<br><br>The high cost of housing in Carthage is having a serious impact on the city's residents. Many are forced to live in substandard housing, or to spend a large portion of their income on housing costs, which leaves them little money for other basic needs like food, clothing, and healthcare. This has led to an increase in poverty and homelessness in Carthage, and has made it difficult for the city's residents to climb the economic ladder.<br><br>The high cost of housing in Carthage is a serious problem that needs to be addressed. The city's leaders need to make affordable housing a priority and invest in the city's housing stock. They also need to work with organizations like the Mississippi Housing Partnership to increase the availability of affordable units.
