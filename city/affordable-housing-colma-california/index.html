      <h2> The history of affordable housing in Colma, California</h2><p><br>Colma, California is a small city located just south of San Francisco. The city is known for being the final resting place for many of San Francisco's deceased, as over 1.5 million people are buried in Colma's cemeteries.<br><br>Despite its small size, Colma has a long history of affordable housing. In the early 1900s, the city was home to a large Italian immigrant population. These immigrants worked in the city's many funeral homes and cemeteries. To house this population, the city built a number of affordable apartments and boarding houses.<br><br>The Great Depression hit Colma hard, as many of the city's residents were out of work. To help ease the burden on its residents, the city created a number of public works projects, including the construction of an affordable housing complex. This complex, known as Sleepy Hollow, provided much-needed housing for Colma's residents.<br><br>Today, Colma continues to be a city with a high concentration of affordable housing. Over one-third of the city's housing units are classified as affordable, and the city has been recognized by the National Low Income Housing Coalition as one of the nation's top ten most affordable places to live.<p><h2> How affordable housing is changing Colma, California</h2><p><br>When it comes to affordable housing, the city of Colma, California is certainly changing. In recent years, the city has seen a number of new developments that are aimed at providing affordable housing options for residents. This is a positive change for the city, as it is becoming increasingly difficult to find affordable housing in the Bay Area.<br><br>One of the most notable changes in Colma has been the development of the Colma Community Housing Initiative. This initiative is a partnership between the city and a number of private developers, and it is designed to create new affordable housing units in the city. So far, the initiative has been successful in creating nearly 200 new units of affordable housing.<br><br>In addition to the Colma Community Housing Initiative, the city has also been working to make it easier for residents to build granny units on their property. A granny unit is a small, self-contained unit that can be used as a rental unit or as additional living space for family members. The city has waived certain fees and regulations that made it difficult to build granny units in the past, and this has resulted in a significant increase in the number of granny units being built in Colma.<br><br>The city of Colma is also working to improve its public transportation options, which will make it easier for residents to get around without a car.

These improvements will make it easier for residents to access affordable housing in Colma.<br><br>Overall, the city of Colma is taking a number of steps to improve its affordable housing options.

Housing counseling agencies can provide information about affordable housing options in Colma and can also help you navigate the application process. <br><br>5.

When people have stable housing, they are more likely to be productive citizens and less likely to end up in the criminal justice system.
