This is a reality for many people across the country, and it's something that is especially difficult for low-income families.<br><br>In Hartley, Iowa, the average rent for a two-bedroom apartment is $735. For a family of four, this would be a very difficult amount to afford. And it's not just rent that is expensive. The cost of food, healthcare, and other essential items continues to rise as well.<br><br>There are a few options for affordable housing in Hartley. The Hartley Housing Authority manages several low-income housing developments. There are also a few non-profit organizations that offer assistance with housing. But the need for affordable housing far exceeds the supply.<br><br>One way to help address the affordable housing crisis is to donate to or volunteer with organizations that provide assistance to low-income families. By doing this, you can help make a difference in the lives of those who are struggling to make ends meet.<p>
