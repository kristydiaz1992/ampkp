      <h2> Nashwauk's Affordable Housing Dilemma</h2><p><br>Nashwauk is a small town in Minnesota with a population of just over 1,000 people. The town has been struggling with a lack of affordable housing for many years. In fact, the issue has become so dire that the town has been dubbed the "Affordable Housing Capital of Minnesota."<br><br>There are several reasons why Nashwauk has been struggling with affordable housing. One reason is that the town is located in the Iron Range, which is an area of Minnesota that has been hit hard by the decline of the iron ore mining industry. As a result, many people in the town have lost their jobs and have been unable to find new ones. This has put a strain on the town's housing market, as people can no longer afford to pay for their homes.<br><br>Another reason for Nashwauk's affordable housing dilemma is that the town is located in a rural area. This means that there is a limited amount of land available for development. As a result, there has been very little new construction in Nashwauk, which has made it difficult for people to find affordable housing.<br><br>The town has been working on a plan to build a new housing development that would be specifically for low- and moderate-income families. However, the project has been delayed due to a lack of funding. In the meantime, the town has been working with a local non-profit to provide temporary housing for families in need.<br><br>Nashwauk's affordable housing dilemma is a complex issue that will require a multi-faceted approach to solve. However, the town is committed to finding a solution that will work for everyone.<p><h2> Why Nashwauk's Affordable Housing Crisis is only getting worse</h2><p><br>Nashwauk, Minnesota is a small town in the Iron Range region of the state. The town has a long history of mining and logging, but the last few decades have seen a decline in these industries. This has led to a decline in the town's population and a decrease in the number of available jobs.<br><br>The decline of these industries has also led to a decrease in the number of affordable housing options in Nashwauk. The town has a limited number of rentals, and the average rent for a two-bedroom apartment is $650. This is unaffordable for many of the town's residents, who have an average household income of just over $30,000.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing in Nashwauk is only getting worse as the town's population continues to decline. The number of vacant homes is increasing, and many of these homes are being purchased by investors who are not interested in renting them out to residents. This is leading to an increase in homelessness in the town, as well as a decrease in the number of families who are able to live in Nashwauk.<br><br>The town's affordable housing crisis is having a negative impact on its residents, and it is only getting worse. The town needs to find a way to attract new businesses and industries, and it needs to find a way to provide its residents with more affordable housing options. Otherwise, the town is at risk of becoming a ghost town.<p><h2> How Nashwauk is tackling its Affordable Housing Problem</h2><p><br>Nashwauk is a small town in Minnesota with a population of just over 1,000 people.

This is far above the national averages of $119,600 for median home prices and $735 for median rent for a two-bedroom apartment.<br><br>The town has been working on a number of initiatives to try and address the affordable housing crisis. In 2018, the town approved a $1 million bond to be used for affordable housing initiatives. The money from the bond will be used to create a housing trust fund, which will provide loans and grants to developers to build new affordable housing units. The town is also working with a local non-profit to create a community land trust, which will help keep housing affordable for future generations.<br><br>The town has also taken a number of steps to try and make it easier for people to build their own homes. In 2018, the town council passed an ordinance that allows people to build tiny homes on their properties. The town is also working on a plan to allow people to build accessory dwelling units (ADUs) on their properties. ADUs are small homes that can be built on a property along with a primary dwelling unit. They can be used for a number of purposes, including providing housing for family members or renters.<br><br>The town of Nashwauk is facing a significant affordable housing crisis.
