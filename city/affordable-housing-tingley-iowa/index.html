The waiting list for subsidized housing is currently over two years long, and there are not enough units to meet the demand.<br><br>The city has been working on a plan to build more affordable housing, but the project has been delayed due to lack of funding. In the meantime, families are struggling to make ends meet and are forced to live in substandard housing or even on the street.<br><br>If you are interested in helping to address the affordable housing crisis in Tingley, Iowa, there are a few ways you can get involved.

There is a need for more affordable housing units, but the town does not have the money to build them. The town is also working to attract new businesses and create new jobs, but this takes time and it is difficult to attract businesses to a town that does not have enough housing for their employees.
