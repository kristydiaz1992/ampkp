However, there are some drawbacks to living in Ridgely that should be considered before making the move. <br><br>One of the biggest drawbacks is the lack of quality schools in the town. The town is served by the Caroline County Public School District, which is one of the lowest-performing school districts in the state. This means that students in Ridgely will likely not receive the same quality of education as students in other parts of the state. <br><br>Another drawback to living in Ridgely is the lack of job opportunities. The town has a population of just over 2,000 people, and the majority of residents work in low-paying jobs.

However, the town does offer some affordable housing options. If you are considering moving to Ridgely, be sure to weigh the pros and cons before making your decision.<p><h2>The future of affordable housing in Ridgely, Maryland</h2><p><br><br>There is no doubt that affordable housing is one of the most important issues facing our country today.

In fact, the town is currently facing a lawsuit from the Maryland Attorney General's office for allegedly violating the state's fair housing laws. The town is accused of unlawfully refusing to allow a low-income housing development to be built, which would have provided much-needed homes for families in the area.<br><br>The town of Ridgely has defended its actions, saying that the proposed development would not have been compatible with the town's character. However, the Maryland Attorney General's office has argued that the town's actions were discriminatory and violated the state's fair housing laws.<br><br>The case is still pending, but it highlights the need for more affordable housing in the town of Ridgely and across the country. It is clear that something needs to be done to address the affordable housing crisis, and it is hopeful that the town of Ridgely will be a leader in finding a solution.<p>
