By living close to work, people can save money on transportation costs and have more money to spend on other necessities.<br><br>Affordable housing is also important because it can help to reduce crime.

Families are being forced to live in cars, shelters, or even on the street. Children are missing school because they don't have a stable place to call home.

In the meantime, the residents of Atlanta are suffering. They deserve better.<p><h2>The impact of affordable housing on the economy of Atlanta, Illinois.</h2><p><br>There is a direct correlation between the availability of affordable housing and the overall health of a city's economy.

The median household income is $36,000, and the median home value is $103,000.<br><br>In recent years, the city has made a concerted effort to increase the availability of affordable housing.
