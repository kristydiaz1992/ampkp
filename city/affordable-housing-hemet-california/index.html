They named the city Hemet, after the Egyptian city of Memphis. The city was originally planned as a retirement community for Civil War veterans, but it quickly grew into a thriving community.<br><br>The city's growth was spurred by the construction of the Southern Pacific Railroad in 1883 and the establishment of the Hemet Land Company in 1887. The Hemet Land Company was responsible for the city's early development, and its chairman, Cyrus A. Stanfield, is credited with naming the city.<br><br>The city continued to grow throughout the early 20th century, and by the 1950s it was the largest city in Riverside County.
