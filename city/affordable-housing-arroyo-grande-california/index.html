      <h2>Advocates call for more affordable housing in Arroyo Grande</h2><p><br>As the cost of living in California continues to rise, advocates are calling for more affordable housing options in the state. In Arroyo Grande, a city located in San Luis Obispo County, the average rent for a one-bedroom apartment is $1,500. For many residents, this is simply not affordable.<br><br>There is a need for more housing that is affordable for families and individuals who work in Arroyo Grande. The city is home to many service industry jobs, such as those in the hospitality and retail industries. These jobs often do not pay a livable wage, yet the cost of housing continues to increase.<br><br>Advocates are calling for the city to create more affordable housing options. One way to do this is to provide incentives for developers to build more affordable housing. Another way is to create more zoning regulations that would require a certain percentage of new developments to be dedicated to affordable housing.<br><br>Whatever the solution, it is clear that something needs to be done to address the affordable housing crisis in Arroyo Grande. Otherwise, many residents will be forced to move out of the city in search of more affordable options.<p><h2>New affordable housing development breaks ground in Arroyo Grande</h2><p><br>The Arroyo Grande City Council has approved a new affordable housing development that will provide much-needed homes for low-income residents in the community. The development, called The Arroyo, will be built on a vacant lot on the corner of Templeton and Oak Streets.<br><br>The Arroyo will have 33 units, including 24 one-bedroom units and 9 two-bedroom units. The units will be reserved for households earning up to 60% of the area median income.<br><br>The development will also include a community room, a playground, and a laundry facility. Construction is expected to begin in the next few months and be completed by early 2020.<br><br>This new development is a much-needed addition to the Arroyo Grande community. It will provide quality, affordable housing for low-income residents and help to address the city’s housing crisis.<p><h2>City Council approves first step toward more affordable housing</h2><p><br>The City Council approved the first step toward more affordable housing at its meeting Tuesday night. The council unanimously voted to approve an ordinance that allows for the creation of a Housing Trust Fund.<br><br>The Housing Trust Fund will be used to provide loans and grants to developers who build or rehabilitate housing that is affordable for low- and moderate-income households. The ordinance also establishes a seven-member Housing Trust Fund Commission that will oversee the fund.<br><br>The council also approved a resolution that calls for a study of the feasibility of creating a Community Land Trust. A Community Land Trust is a nonprofit corporation that owns land and manages it for the benefit of the community. The trust sells or leases land to qualified buyers or lessees, who then build or maintain homes or businesses on the property. The Community Land Trust model has been used successfully in other cities to create and preserve affordable housing.<br><br>The council’s actions are the first steps in a multi-pronged approach to address the city’s affordable housing crisis. In the coming months, the council will consider additional ordinances and resolutions that will create more affordable housing opportunities for city residents.<p><h2>Arroyo Grande residents voice concerns about affordable housing</h2><p><br>Arroyo Grande residents are concerned about the lack of affordable housing in the city. The median home price in Arroyo Grande is $689,000, and the median rent is $2,195, according to Zillow.com.<br><br>The city's Housing Element, which is required by state law, identifies the need for 1,290 new housing units by 2023. Of those, 645 units are earmarked for low- and very-low-income residents.<br><br>The city has been working on an inclusionary housing ordinance, which would require developers to set aside a certain number of units for low- and moderate-income residents. However, the ordinance has been met with opposition from the business community.<br><br>The city is also considering a program that would use city-owned land to build affordable housing. However, there is concern that this could lead to the displacement of existing businesses.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing is a major concern for Arroyo Grande residents. The city is working on several initiatives to address the issue, but it remains to be seen whether these will be successful.<p><h2>Arroyo Grande could see more affordable housing if city makes changes</h2><p><br><br>Arroyo Grande could see more affordable housing if city makes changes to its development code, according to a new report.<br><br>The report, prepared by the firm Housing Element Solutions, found that the city’s current development code includes a number of barriers to the development of affordable housing.<br><br>Among the barriers identified in the report are the city’s minimum lot size requirement, which the report says “unnecessarily limits the production of small, more affordable housing units.”<br><br>The report also found that the city’s “inclusionary housing” ordinance, which requires that a certain percentage of units in new developments be set aside for low- and moderate-income households, is not being enforced.<br><br>The report recommends that the city eliminate its minimum lot size requirement, and enforce its inclusionary housing ordinance.<br><br>The report was commissioned by the city in response to the state’s mandate that all cities plan for their fair share of regional housing needs.<p>
