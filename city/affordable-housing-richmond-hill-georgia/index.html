However, there are many programs and initiatives in place that make affordable housing accessible to a wide range of people.<br><br>Here are 5 myths about affordable housing in Richmond Hill:<br><br>1. Affordable housing is only for low-income earners<br><br>This is one of the most common myths about affordable housing.

For example, the Ontario government offers a housing allowance to those who are struggling to pay their rent.<br><br>2. Affordable housing is only available in the city<br><br>Another myth about affordable housing is that it’s only available in big cities. However, this is not the case.

Affordable housing is only available to those with perfect credit<br><br>Many people believe that you need to have perfect credit to qualify for affordable housing. However, this is not always the case. There are many programs that offer housing to those with less-than-perfect credit.<br><br>4.

There are many programs that offer housing to those who are unemployed or underemployed.<br><br>5. Affordable housing is only available to those who are Canadian citizens<br><br>This is not true!

But what does affordable housing actually mean?<br><br>According to the Ontario government, affordable housing is “safe, adequate and affordable housing that meets the needs of all Ontarians, including people with special needs.”<br><br>So, how does this stack up against the reality in Richmond Hill?<br><br>Well, according to the 2016 Census, the median rent for a one-bedroom apartment in Richmond Hill is $1,440. That’s significantly higher than the provincial average of $950.<br><br>And it’s not just rent that’s expensive in Richmond Hill. The average house price in the city is $1,356,000, which is out of reach for many people.<br><br>So, what can be done to make housing more affordable in Richmond Hill?<br><br>One idea is to build more dencity. This would create more housing options and help to drive down prices.<br><br>Another idea is to create more incentives for developers to build affordable housing.
