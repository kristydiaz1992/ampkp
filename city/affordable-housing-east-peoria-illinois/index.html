      <h2> The Impact of Affordable Housing on East Peoria's Economy</h2><p><br>East Peoria is a city in Central Illinois with a population of 23,402. The city is situated on the Illinois River and is part of the Peoria metropolitan area. East Peoria is home to many businesses and industries, including Caterpillar Inc., Illinois Central College, and OSF Saint Francis Medical Center.<br><br>The city has a strong economy, and its residents enjoy a high quality of life. However, like many other cities in the United States, East Peoria faces a number of challenges, one of which is the high cost of housing.<br><br>The median home price in East Peoria is $128,000, which is significantly higher than the median home price in the rest of the state of Illinois ($103,000). The high cost of housing is a major burden for many families in East Peoria, and it can make it difficult for them to afford other basic necessities, such as food and healthcare.<br><br>The high cost of housing is also a major challenge for businesses in East Peoria. When businesses locate in a city, they often look for areas where their employees can afford to live. The high cost of housing in East Peoria makes it difficult for businesses to attract and retain employees, which can ultimately lead to a decline in the city's economy.<br><br>Affordable housing is an important issue for East Peoria, and it is one that needs to be addressed in order to ensure the city's long-term economic prosperity.<br><br>There are a number of ways to create more affordable housing in East Peoria. One way is to encourage more home construction. This can be done by providing incentives to developers who build new housing developments that include a certain percentage of affordable units.<br><br>Another way to create more affordable housing is to provide financial assistance to families who are struggling to pay their rent or mortgage. This can be done through programs like the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program, which provides subsidies to families who meet certain income requirements.<br><br>The city of East Peoria has also taken steps to create more affordable housing by reforming its zoning laws. In 2017, the city council approved a new zoning ordinance that allows for the construction of more multifamily dwellings, such as apartments and townhouses. This change in the zoning laws has made it easier for developers to build new housing developments that include a higher percentage of affordable units.<br><br>The city of East Peoria is committed to creating more affordable housing, and it is taking a number of steps to achieve this goal. By encouraging more home construction, reforming its zoning laws, and providing financial assistance to families who need it, East Peoria is working to make sure that its residents can afford to live in the city and that businesses can thrive.<p><h2> The Benefits of Affordable Housing for Families in East Peoria</h2><p><br>There are many benefits of affordable housing for families in East Peoria. One of the most obvious benefits is that it can help families save money on their monthly expenses. According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, the average rent for a two-bedroom apartment in East Peoria is $647, which is significantly lower than the national average of $1,082. This can make a big difference for families who are struggling to make ends meet.<br><br>Another benefit of affordable housing is that it can help families live in safe and clean environments. Many low-income families are forced to live in substandard housing conditions because they cannot afford anything better. This can lead to health problems and other serious issues. However, when families have access to affordable housing, they can live in safe and clean homes that are not as likely to cause health problems.<br><br>Finally, affordable housing can help families access essential services and resources. Many low-income families live in areas that do not have access to quality schools, grocery stores, and other essential services. This can make it difficult for families to get the resources they need to improve their lives. However, when families live in affordable housing, they are more likely to have access to these essential resources.<br><br>Overall, affordable housing can have a profound impact on families in East Peoria. It can help families save money, live in safe and clean homes, and access essential resources. This can make a big difference in the lives of low-income families.<p><h2> The Challenges of Affordable Housing in East Peoria</h2><p><br>The city of East Peoria, Illinois is facing a affordable housing crisis. The problem is most acute for low-income residents, who are struggling to find safe and affordable places to live. The city has a long history of manufacturing and agriculture, but recent years have seen a decline in these industries. This has led to a decline in the city’s tax base, which has made it difficult to fund affordable housing initiatives.<br><br>The city’s affordable housing crisis is exacerbated by its location. East Peoria is situated in the middle of the state, far from major metropolitan areas. This means that there are few job opportunities for low-income residents. The lack of jobs makes it difficult for residents to afford rent, let alone save up for a down payment on a home.<br><br>The city has taken some steps to address its affordable housing crisis. In 2016, the City Council approved a new ordinance that requires developers to set aside a certain percentage of units for low- and moderate-income residents. The city has also set up a fund to help low-income residents with down payments and other costs associated with buying a home.<br><br>Despite these efforts, the city’s affordable housing crisis remains a major concern. Low-income residents are still struggling to find safe and affordable places to live. The lack of jobs and affordable housing options is leading to a decline in the city’s population. If the city does not take action to address its affordable housing crisis, it risks becoming a ghost town.<p><h2> The Future of Affordable Housing in East Peoria</h2><p><br>As the City of East Peoria continues to grow, the demand for affordable housing will only increase. The City is committed to meeting this demand by working with developers to create new affordable housing opportunities.<br><br>One way the City is working to create more affordable housing is through its Housing Incentive Program. The program offers developers financial incentives to create new housing developments that include a certain percentage of units that are affordable for low- and moderate-income households.<br><br>The City is also working to create more affordable housing through its Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program. The CDBG program provides funding to help develop housing for low- and moderate-income households.<br><br>The City is committed to meeting the demand for affordable housing and will continue to work with developers to create new affordable housing opportunities.<p><h2> The Importance of Affordable Housing for Seniors in East Peoria</h2><p><br><br>As the population of seniors in East Peoria continues to grow, the need for affordable housing becomes more important. According to the National Council on Aging, there are more than 46 million adults over the age of 65 in the United States, and that number is expected to grow to over 98 million by 2060.<br><br>One of the biggest challenges facing seniors today is the high cost of housing. According to a report by the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University, the median rent for seniors increased by 35 percent between 2001 and 2016, while the median income for seniors only increased by 18 percent. This means that seniors are spending a larger percentage of their income on housing, leaving less money for other essentials like food, transportation, and healthcare.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing can also lead to social isolation and loneliness, as seniors are forced to move away from their families and friends in order to find an affordable place to live. According to the AARP, social isolation can lead to a decline in physical and mental health, and can increase the risk of early death by up to 30 percent.<br><br>Fortunately, there are a number of organizations in East Peoria that are working to provide affordable housing for seniors. The Senior Housing Assistance Group (SHAG) is a non-profit organization that provides affordable housing and supportive services for seniors. They currently have two properties in East Peoria, with plans to develop more in the future.<br><br>The Peoria Housing Authority also offers a number of affordable housing options for seniors, including the Senior Living Centers and the Silver Oaks Apartments. For more information on these and other affordable housing options in East Peoria, please contact the Senior Services Department at the City of East Peoria.<p>
