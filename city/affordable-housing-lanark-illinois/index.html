This would be a non-profit organization that would work to acquire and manage land for the purpose of developing affordable housing. The Trust would then lease the land to developers who would build housing that would be made available to low- and moderate-income families.<br><br>Another option being explored is the development of “inclusionary zoning” ordinances. These ordinances would require that a certain percentage of units in all new developments be set aside for low- and moderate-income families. Inclusionary zoning has been successfully used in other communities to help ensure that new development includes a mix of housing that is affordable to a variety of different income levels.<br><br>The city of Lanark is also working to identify vacant and underutilized properties that could be redeveloped into new affordable housing. These properties could be purchased by the city or by a non-profit organization and then redeveloped into new housing units. This would help to increase the overall supply of affordable housing in the community.<br><br> affordable housing is an important issue that the city of Lanark is committed to addressing. By exploring a variety of options, the city is working to ensure that there is an adequate supply of affordable housing available to meet the needs of its growing population.<p>
