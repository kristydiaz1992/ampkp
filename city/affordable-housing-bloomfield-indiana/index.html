The third challenge is the lack of available land for new development. The town has very little vacant land, and most of it is already spoken for by developers.<br><br>The town is currently working on a number of solutions to these challenges. The first solution is to create a new housing trust fund that will help to finance the construction of new affordable housing units. The second solution is to work with developers to create mixed-use developments that include both market-rate and affordable housing units. The third solution is to rezone some of the town's commercial areas to allow for residential development.<br><br>All of these solutions will take time to implement, and it will be years before the town sees a significant increase in the supply of affordable housing. In the meantime, the town is working to help families who are struggling to find affordable housing.
