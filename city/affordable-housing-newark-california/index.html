As a result, many Newark residents have difficulty finding affordable housing.<br><br>The City of Newark has made a number of attempts to address the issue of affordable housing.

In a city like Newark where land is scarce and the cost of land is high, it can be difficult to develop new housing that is affordable for low- and moderate-income families.<br><br>One solution that has been proposed is to create incentives for developers to create more affordable housing. For example, the city could offer tax breaks or other financial incentives to developers who create housing that is affordable for low- and moderate-income families.<br><br>Another solution that has been proposed is to increase the supply of affordable housing by building more public housing. While this option would likely require significant investment from the city, it could be a viable option for providing more affordable housing options for Newark residents.<br><br>Whatever solutions are ultimately adopted, it is clear that the issue of affordable housing in Newark is one that needs to be addressed in the years to come.
