The town has a population of just over 1,000 people and is located in the northwest corner of the state. The median household income is just over $30,000, and the median home value is just under $100,000.

There are only about 60 homes on the market, and the average rental price is $850 per month. This leaves many people struggling to find a place to live. The other challenge is that many of the homes that are available are in poor condition.
