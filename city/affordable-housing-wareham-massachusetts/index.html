      <h2>Wareham's Affordable Housing Problem</h2><p><br>The town of Wareham, Massachusetts is facing an affordable housing crisis. The town's median home price is $325,000, which is out of reach for many residents. The town's median income is $52,000, which means that many residents cannot afford to buy a home. The town's rent prices are also high, with the average rent for a two-bedroom apartment being $1,500. The town's affordable housing crisis is exacerbated by the fact that there are few affordable housing options available. The town has very few rentals available, and the few rentals that are available are often expensive. The town also has very few affordable homes for sale. The town's affordable housing crisis is having a negative impact on the town's residents. Many residents are forced to live in overcrowded and unsafe conditions. The town's affordable housing crisis is also causing many residents to move out of the town. Wareham's affordable housing crisis needs to be addressed urgently. The town needs to develop more affordable housing options, and the town's residents need to be made aware of the affordable housing options that are available.<p><h2>The Lack of Affordable Housing in Wareham</h2><p><br>There's no doubt that the lack of affordable housing is a huge problem in Wareham. According to a report from the Wareham Housing Authority, the town has a total of just over 1,000 housing units that are considered affordable for low- and moderate-income households. That means that there are only enough affordable homes for about one-third of the town's population.<br><br>The Wareham Housing Authority also reports that the average rent for a two-bedroom apartment in town is about $1,500 per month. That's far out of reach for many families, especially those who are struggling to make ends meet.<br><br>The town's lack of affordable housing is also having an impact on its businesses. According to the Wareham Chamber of Commerce, several businesses have had to close their doors because they can't find workers who can afford to live in town.<br><br>The chamber is working with the town to try to find solutions to the affordable housing crisis. One idea that's being discussed is creating a community land trust, which would allow the town to buy and hold land for the purpose of developing affordable housing.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing in Wareham is a serious problem that needs to be addressed.
