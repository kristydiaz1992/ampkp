This leaves little room for other essentials, such as food and transportation.<br><br>There are a number of factors that contribute to the high cost of housing in Bryant. One is the fact that the city is located in the Greater Little Rock metropolitan area, which is one of the most expensive housing markets in the country. Another factor is the lack of available land for new development. This has led to a limited supply of housing, which in turn has driven up prices.<br><br>The city has taken some steps to address the issue of affordable housing, but more needs to be done.
