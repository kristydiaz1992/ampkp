      <h2> Pawnee's Affordable Housing Crisis</h2><p><br>Pawnee's affordable housing crisis is one of the most pressing issues facing our community today. The lack of affordable housing is a major contributor to poverty and homelessnes and it affects families and individuals of all ages.<br><br>The problem is especially severe for low-income families, who often have to choose between paying rent and other basic necessities like food and healthcare. According to a recent study, nearly half of all renters in Pawnee are considered "cost-burdened," meaning they spend more than 30% of their income on housing.<br><br>There are many factors that have contributed to our affordable housing crisis, including the rising cost of living, the loss of manufacturing jobs, and the lack of investment in affordable housing. However, the most significant factor is the lack of available affordable housing.<br><br>In Pawnee, the average rent for a two-bedroom apartment is $1,250 per month. For a family of four, that's more than $15,000 per year. The median income in Pawnee is just over $22,000, so it's clear that many families simply can't afford to pay rent.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing has also led to an increase in homelessness. According to the most recent homeless count, there are nearly 1,500 people experiencing homelessness in Pawnee. That's an increase of nearly 20% from the previous year.<br><br>The situation is dire, but there is hope.
