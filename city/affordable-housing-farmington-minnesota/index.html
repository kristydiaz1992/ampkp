This is well below the national average of 7.2 percent.<br><br>There are a number of factors that contribute to the high cost of housing in Dakota County. The first is the strong economy. The county has a diverse economy with a mix of manufacturing, service, and retail businesses.

In Dakota County, only 12 percent of all housing units are rentals, and of those, only a small percentage are affordable to low-income households. The high cost of land and the limited availability of funding for affordable housing development make it difficult to build new rental units that are affordable to low-income households.<br><br>The high cost of housing is also due to the low supply of units. In Dakota County, the number of housing units has not kept pace with the population growth. The population of the county has grown by 21 percent since 2000, but the number of housing units has only increased by 9 percent. This results in high demand and competition for housing, which drives up prices.<br><br>There are a number of programs and initiatives that are working to increase the supply of affordable housing in Dakota County. The Dakota County Affordable Housing Incentive Program provides financial incentives to developers who build or rehabilitate housing that is affordable to low- and moderate-income households. The program has resulted in the construction or rehabilitation of over 1,500 units of affordable housing since it was established in 2002.<br><br>Another program is the Dakota County Housing Partnership, which provides financing and technical assistance to developers of affordable housing. The Partnership has helped to finance the construction or rehabilitation of over 4,000 units of affordable housing since it was established in 1995.<br><br>The City of Burnsville also has a number of programs and incentives to encourage the development of affordable housing.
