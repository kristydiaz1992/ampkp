The first step is to assess the needs of the community and then work to develop programs and policies that address those needs.<br><br>One way to increase the availability of affordable housing is to create incentives for developers to build more units. These incentives could include tax breaks, expedited permitting, or other financial incentives. The city could also create or expand programs that provide direct assistance to low-income households, such as housing vouchers or down payment assistance.<br><br>Another solution is to change zoning laws to allow for more density, which would make it possible to build more housing units in a given area. This would require careful planning to ensure that the additional density does not lead to increased traffic congestion or other negative impacts.<br><br>It will be important to involve the community in these discussions and to consider a variety of solutions that address the needs of all residents.

More than half of respondents reported experiencing depression, anxiety, or other mental health problems, and one-third said they had skipped meals or cut back on food because they couldn't afford it.<br><br>The affordable housing crisis is also affecting the ability of residents to work and participate in the local economy.
