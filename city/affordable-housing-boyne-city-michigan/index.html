When people can't afford to live in a community, it can lead to all sorts of problems. For one, it can lead to increased crime rates, as people are more likely to commit crimes when they're desperate. It can also lead to a decline in the quality of schools, as families move away from areas where they can't afford to live. And, it can create a feeling of isolation and despair among residents, as they feel like they can't participate in the life of their community.<br><br>Affordable housing is essential for a vibrant community because it allows people of all income levels to live there.

But it can also happen in small towns, like Boyne City, Michigan.<br><br>In Boyne City, the median home price is $131,000, but the median income is only $36,000. This means that many residents are struggling to afford their homes. And as more people move into the town, prices are only going up.<br><br>This is a problem for many low-income residents, who may be forced to move out of the town they've called home for their entire lives. It's also a problem for the town as a whole, as it loses the diversity that makes it special.<br><br>So what can be done to prevent or reverse gentrification in Boyne City?<br><br>There are a few things that could be done, such as:<br><br>- Providing incentives for developers to build affordable housing<br>- Making it easier for residents to get loans to purchase or renovate their homes<br>- Creating community land trusts to keep homes affordable in perpetuity<br><br>All of these solutions require investment from the government or other institutions. But if Boyne City wants to maintain its character and ensure that its residents can afford to stay, it's worth considering.<p><h2>How Boyne City is Responding to the Affordable Housing Shortage</h2><p><br><br><br><br>The Boyne City Commission has recently taken up the issue of affordable housing in the city. The city has been grappling with an affordable housing shortage for some time, and the commission is hoping to find a way to address the issue.<br><br>One of the first steps the commission is taking is to commission a study to examine the issue and to make recommendations on how to address it. The commission is also working with local organizations to identify potential solutions.<br><br>One potential solution that is being explored is the development of a community land trust. This would allow the city to purchase land and then lease it to developers who would build affordable housing. The city would then have control over the prices of the units, ensuring that they remain affordable for those who need it.<br><br>The commission is also looking at other potential solutions, such as providing incentives for developers to build affordable housing, or working with non-profit organizations to create more affordable housing options.<br><br>The city is still in the early stages of exploring its options, but it is clear that the issue of affordable housing is a top priority for the commission. With the help of the community, the city is hopeful that it can find a way to address the shortage and ensure that everyone has a place to call home.<p>
