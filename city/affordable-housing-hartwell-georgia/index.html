This leaves a gap of $86,936, which many families cannot afford.<br><br>There are several proposed solutions to the affordable housing crisis, but it is unclear which one will be most effective. One proposal is to create more low-income housing developments, which would provide families with an affordable place to live. Another proposal is to create incentives for developers to build more affordable housing, such as offering tax breaks or increasing subsidies.<br><br>It is clear that something needs to be done to address the affordable housing crisis in Hartwell, Georgia.
