According to a report by the National Low Income Housing Coalition, the average two-bedroom apartment in Post Falls costs $819 per month, which is far out of reach for many low-income families. The report also found that there are only 17 affordable and available rental homes for every 100 extremely low-income renters in Post Falls.<br><br>The high cost of housing is not only a challenge for low-income families, but also for middle-income earners. A family of four earning the median income in Post Falls would need to spend nearly half of their income (48%) on housing in order to afford a two-bedroom apartment at the fair market rent.<br><br>There are a number of factors that contribute to the lack of affordable housing in Post Falls. The first is the lack of available land. With Post Falls being largely built out, there is little room for new development, which drives up the cost of land and new construction. Additionally, the median home price in Post Falls is $234,000, which is out of reach for many families.<br><br>The high cost of housing is also due in part to the fact that Post Falls is a desirable place to live. The city has a low crime rate, good schools, and a growing economy, which all make it an attractive place to live. However, this also means that there is high demand for housing, which drives up prices.<br><br>There are a number of initiatives underway to try to address the affordable housing challenge in Post Falls. The city has adopted an inclusionary zoning ordinance, which requires that a certain percentage of new developments include affordable units. The city is also working with a number of non-profit organizations to develop and preserve affordable housing. However, the lack of available land and the high cost of construction mean that these efforts will likely only make a dent in the problem.<br><br>The affordable housing challenge in Post Falls is likely to continue to be a major issue in the years to come. With the cost of living and housing continuing to rise, more and more families are being priced out of the city. This is not only a problem for those families, but also for the city as a whole. A lack of affordable housing can lead to increased crime and poverty, as well as a brain drain as young families leave the city in search of more affordable options. The city of Post Falls will need to continue to look for creative solutions to address this challenge.<p><h2> How to make affordable housing a reality in Post Falls, Idaho</h2><p><br><br>There is no one-size-fits-all answer to the question of how to make affordable housing a reality in Post Falls, Idaho. However, there are a number of ways to make affordable housing more attainable for Idahoans.<br><br>One way to make affordable housing a reality in Idaho is to create incentives for developers to build more affordable housing.

This could be done through public-private partnerships, increased government funding, or philanthropic donations.<br><br>Another way to make affordable housing a reality in Idaho is to create more affordable housing units. This could be done through increased density bonuses, small lot subdivisions, or accessory dwelling units.<br><br>Making affordable housing a reality in Idaho will require a multifaceted approach. By taking a variety of steps to increase affordable housing options, we can make sure that everyone in Idaho has a place to call home.<p>
