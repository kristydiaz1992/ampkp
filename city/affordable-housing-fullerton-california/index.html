A recent report by the Fullerton Housing Authority found that the city has a limited supply of affordable housing, and that the existing units are at risk of being lost to market-rate development.<br><br>The report found that the city has just 2,752 affordable housing units, which is only enough to serve 10.6 percent of its low- and moderate-income households. This leaves a significant number of residents who are struggling to find affordable places to live.<br><br>The situation is made even worse by the fact that many of the city's existing affordable units are at risk of being lost to market-rate development. In the past decade, Fullerton has lost nearly 1,000 units of affordable housing, and another 1,000 units are at risk of being lost in the next decade.<br><br>The city is taking steps to address the problem, but it is clear that more needs to be done to ensure that everyone has a place to call home.<br><br>What are your thoughts on this issue? Do you think the city is doing enough to address the problem?<p><h2>The Impact of Affordable Housing on Fullerton's Economy</h2><p><br>There is no doubt that affordable housing is having a positive impact on Fullerton's economy. By providing residents with stable, affordable housing options, Fullerton is able to attract and retain a strong workforce. This, in turn, leads to increased economic activity and job growth.<br><br>In addition, affordable housing helps to boost local businesses. When residents have stable, affordable housing, they are more likely to spend their money locally. This supports the growth of small businesses and helps to keep the local economy strong.<br><br>Overall, affordable housing is having a positive impact on Fullerton's economy. By providing residents with stable, affordable housing options, Fullerton is able to attract and retain a strong workforce. This, in turn, leads to increased economic activity and job growth.<p><h2>The Pros and Cons of Affordable Housing in Fullerton</h2><p><br>There is no question that the need for affordable housing is great in Fullerton and across the country. The National Low Income Housing Coalition reports that there is a shortage of 7.2 million affordable and available rental homes for extremely low income renters. And, according to the National Housing Conference, the number of cost-burdened renters (those paying more than 30% of their income on rent) increased from 21.3 million in 2001 to 43.3 million in 2016.<br><br>The high cost of housing is a major contributor to poverty and homelessnes<br><br>In Fullerton, the median rent for a two-bedroom apartment is $1,890, which is unaffordable for many residents. The median income for renters in Fullerton is $37,460, which means that a family would have to spend more than half of their income on rent to afford a two-bedroom apartment.<br><br>The high cost of housing is a major contributor to poverty and homelessness. In Fullerton, there are 1,890 households with incomes below the poverty level and 1,112 people who are homeless.<br><br>The city has taken some steps to address the affordable housing problem. In 2016, the city adopted an inclusionary housing ordinance, which requires that 20% of the units in new developments with 30 or more units be set aside for low- and moderate-income households. The city has also created a Housing Trust Fund, which provides financing for affordable housing projects.<br><br>Despite these efforts, the need for affordable housing in Fullerton far exceeds the available supply. This is where the city’s affordable housing policy comes into play.<br><br>The city’s policy is based on the belief that everyone deserves a safe, decent, and affordable place to live. The city’s goal is to create and preserve 5,000 new and existing affordable housing units for very low, low-, and moderate-income households by the year 2029.<br><br>The city’s policy has four main goals:<br><br>1. Increase the production of new affordable housing.<br><br>2. Preserve existing affordable housing.<br><br>3. Increase the availability of housing for extremely low-income households.<br><br>4. Increase the availability of supportive housing.<br><br>To achieve these goals, the city’s policy includes a number of strategies, such as providing funding for affordable housing projects, reforming the city’s zoning code, and creating incentives for developers to build affordable housing.<br><br>The city’s affordable housing policy has been successful in increasing the production of new affordable housing. From 2015 to 2017, the city approved the construction of 1,879 new affordable housing units. This is a significant increase from the period of 2010 to 2014, when the city approved the construction of only 642 new affordable housing units.<br><br>The city’s policy has also been successful in preserving existing affordable housing. From 2015 to 2017, the city assisted in the preservation of 1,711 affordable housing units. This is a significant increase from the period of 2010 to 2014, when the city assisted in the preservation of only 909 affordable housing units.<br><br>The city’s policy has also helped to increase the availability of housing for extremely low-income households. From 2015 to 2017, the city approved the construction of 821 units of housing for extremely low-income households. This is a significant increase from the period of 2010 to 2014, when the city approved the construction of only 362 units of housing for extremely low-income households.<br><br>The city’s policy has also helped to increase the availability of supportive housing. From 2015 to 2017, the city approved the construction of 442 units of supportive housing. This is a significant increase from the period of 2010 to 2014, when the city approved the construction of only 180 units of supportive housing.<br><br>The city’s affordable housing policy has been successful in increasing the production of new affordable housing. However, the policy has had mixed results in terms of preserving existing affordable housing and increasing the availability of housing for extremely low-income households. The city’s affordable housing policy has been successful in increasing the availability of supportive housing.<p><h2>The History of Affordable Housing in Fullerton</h2><p><br><br>When one thinks of affordable housing, Fullerton may not be the first city that comes to mind. However, the city has a long and interesting history when it comes to providing affordable housing options for its residents.<br><br>The first recorded instance of affordable housing in Fullerton dates back to the early 1900s, when the city established a “tent city” for those who could not afford traditional housing. The tent city was located on what is now the site of the Fullerton Sports Complex and consisted of around 100 tents. The residents of the tent city were mostly laborers who worked in the nearby orange groves.<br><br>In the 1920s, the city began to develop a more formal system of affordable housing. The first project was the Fullerton Heights subdivision, which was built on land donated by the city. The homes in Fullerton Heights were small, but they were a vast improvement over the tents of the previous decade.<br><br>The Great Depression hit Fullerton hard, but the city did its best to provide for its residents. In 1933, the city built the Fullerton Municipal Camp, which provided housing for unemployed men. The camp was located on what is now the site of the Fullerton Golf Course.<br><br>After World War II, the need for affordable housing in Fullerton increased dramatically. The city responded by approving a number of subdivisions that were built specifically for veterans. These subdivisions included Veterans Village, which is now the site of the Fullerton Museum Center, and Veterans Memorial Park, which is still a popular recreation spot for city residents.<br><br>In the 1960s, the city began to focus on providing affordable housing for low-income families. The first project was the Fullerton Redevelopment Agency, which was created to help revitalize the downtown area. The agency helped to build a number of low-income housing complexes, including the Villa Del Sol Apartments and the Valencia Apartments.<br><br>The city has continued to provide affordable housing options for its residents over the years. In 2001, the city adopted the Inclusionary Housing Ordinance, which requires that all new developments include a certain percentage of affordable units. The ordinance has helped to create a number of new affordable housing complexes, including the Park Place Apartments and the Villa Park Apartments.<br><br>The city of Fullerton has a long and proud history of providing affordable housing options for its residents. The city has continually worked to find new and innovative ways to meet the needs of its residents, and it is sure to continue to do so in the years to come.<p>
