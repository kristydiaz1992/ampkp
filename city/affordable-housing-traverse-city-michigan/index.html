The issue has been exacerbated by the recent influx of people moving to the area, as well as the high cost of living. This has resulted in a situation where many people are forced to live in substandard housing, or are unable to find housing at all.<br><br>There are a number of factors that have contributed to the current crisis. One is the fact that the area has seen a significant increase in population in recent years. This has put pressure on the housing market, and has driven up prices. Another factor is the high cost of living in the area. This includes the cost of food, transportation, and other essentials.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing is having a number of negative impacts on the community. It is causing families to move out of the area, and is putting a strain on the resources of those who remain. It is also causing problems for businesses, as they are unable to attract and retain employees. This is having a negative effect on the economy as a whole.<br><br>The current crisis in affordable housing is not sustainable, and something needs to be done to address it. The first step is to increase the supply of housing. This can be done through a variety of means, such as increasing the density of development, or by providing incentives for developers to build more affordable housing.<br><br>The second step is to address the issue of the high cost of living. This can be done by providing subsidies for essential services, or by increasing the minimum wage.<br><br>The third step is to improve the quality of life for those who are struggling to make ends meet.

The city has seen a boom in tourism and development in recent years, but this growth has not been accompanied by an increase in affordable housing options. This has led to a situation where many people are being priced out of the city, or are forced to live in substandard housing.<br><br>The problem is compounded by the fact that many of the jobs in Traverse City are low-paying, meaning that even if residents can find housing, they may not be able to afford it. This is having a negative impact on the city's economy, as well as on the quality of life of its residents.<br><br>There are a number of potential solutions to the affordable housing crisis, but it will require cooperation from all levels of government, as well as the private sector.
