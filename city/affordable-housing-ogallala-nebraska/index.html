This can be done through a variety of methods, such as creating more incentives for developers to build affordable housing, increasing funding for existing affordable housing programs, or reforming our zoning laws to allow for more density.<br><br>Whatever the solution, it’s clear that we need to do something to address the affordable housing crisis in Ogallala. Our city is a great place to live, and we want to make sure that it’s accessible to everyone, not just those who can afford to pay top dollar for a home.<p>
