It can help to increase economic opportunity, diversity, and stability, and can improve the overall health and wellbeing of residents.<p><h2> How Affordable Housing is Impacting Watertown's Economy</h2><p><br>Watertown is a town in Massachusetts with a population of just over 24,000. The town is located in Middlesex County, about 10 miles west of Boston.

The town has a very limited amount of affordable housing, and this is having a negative impact on the economy.<br><br>Rents in Watertown have been rising at an alarming rate, and many residents are being priced out of their homes.
