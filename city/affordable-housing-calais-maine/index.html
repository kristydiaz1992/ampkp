There are also a number of mobile home parks in Calais that offer affordable housing options.<p><h2>Why affordable housing is important for Calais, Maine</h2><p><br>Calais is a small city in Maine with a population of just over 3,000 people. The median household income is $36,000 and the median home value is $129,000. Calais has a high poverty rate of 28.3%, which is nearly double the national poverty rate of 14.8%.<br><br>Affordable housing is important for Calais because it provides residents with a place to live that they can afford. Many people in Calais are struggling to make ends meet and housing costs are a major contributor to this problem. According to a study by the National Low Income Housing Coalition, the average renter in Calais spends 52% of their income on rent and utilities. This leaves very little money for other essentials, such as food, clothing, and transportation.<br><br>There are several organizations in Calais that are working to provide affordable housing options for residents. The Calais Housing Authority owns and operates several low-income housing developments. The Calais Area Habitat for Humanity also builds and sells affordable homes to low-income families. These organizations are making a positive impact in the community, but there is still more work to be done.<br><br>It is important for elected officials and city leaders to prioritize affordable housing in Calais. This can be done by increasing funding for existing programs, creating new programs, and reforming zoning laws to allow for more density. By taking these steps, Calais can become a more affordable place to live for all its residents.<p><h2>How to make a case for more affordable housing in Calais, Maine</h2><p><br><br>Calais is a city in Washington County, Maine, in the United States. The population was 3,496 at the 2010 census. The population has since declined to an estimated 3,103 as of 2019. Calais is the primary city of the Calais Micropolitan Statistical Area.<br><br>Calais is located on the St. Croix River, which forms the border between the U.S. state of Maine and the Canadian province of New Brunswick. Calais is the closest U.S. city to New Brunswick's capital city, Fredericton, and is the final destination of the United States' only direct road link to the province, the Akers Ferry Bridge.<br><br>Calais has a long history of shipbuilding. The first shipyard in Calais was established in 1763. During the American Revolution, Calais was occupied by British forces for nine months in 1779–1780. The St. Croix River was an important route for logging during the 19th century, and Calais was the head of tide for steamboats. Calais was also the site of one of the first sawmills in the United States.<br><br>The city is home to the annual Calais International Balloon Festival, which is one of the largest hot air balloon festivals in New England.<br><br>The median income for a household in the city was $27,856, and the median income for a family was $34,712. Males had a median income of $29,518 versus $21,207 for females. The per capita income for the city was $16,077. About 14.8% of families and 18.3% of the population were below the poverty line, including 26.7% of those under age 18 and 16.2% of those age 65 or over.<br><br>Calais is a small city with a limited tax base. The median home value in Calais is $142,500, and the median rent is $705. The median income for a household in Calais is $27,856, and the median income for a family is $34,712. Males had a median income of $29,518 versus $21,207 for females. The per capita income for the city was $16,077. About 14.8% of families and 18.3% of the population were below the poverty line, including 26.7% of those under age 18 and 16.2% of those age 65 or over.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing is a serious problem in Calais. The median rent is $705, and the median home value is $142,500. A family with a median income of $34,712 can only afford a monthly rent of $871, and would need to save for over eight years to afford a down payment on a median-priced home.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing impacts everyone in Calais, but it disproportionately affects low-income households, young families, and seniors. According to the Maine Housing Partnership, there are only 24 affordable and available rental units for every 100 extremely low-income households in Calais. This means that 76% of extremely low-income households in Calais are forced to spend more than half of their income on housing, leaving them little to no money for other basic needs like food, transportation, and healthcare.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing also makes it difficult for young families to stay in Calais. In order to afford a two-bedroom apartment at the median rent, a family would need to earn $17.42 per hour, or $36,288 per year. The Maine Housing Partnership estimates that only 26% of Maine families can afford this rent. This leaves many families no choice but to move to more affordable areas, which leads to increased costs for commuting and child care, and can also result in job loss.<br><br>Seniors are also struggling to afford housing in Calais. Many are on fixed incomes, and the rising cost of housing is compressing their budgets. According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, a senior citizen on Social Security would need to earn $13.65 per hour, or $28,488 per year, to afford a two-bedroom apartment at the median rent.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing is having a negative impact on the Calais community as a whole. Businesses are struggling to attract and retain employees, and the city is losing population. In order to address this issue, the city needs to make a case for more affordable housing.<br><br>One way to make a case for more affordable housing is to highlight the economic benefits that it would bring to the community. According to the National Association of Home Builders, every $1 invested in building or repairing affordable housing generates $4 in economic activity. This includes not just the construction jobs created by the building project, but also the ripple effect of the workers spending their paychecks in the local economy.<br><br>Investing in affordable housing would also help to attract and retain young families in Calais. Young families are an important part of the community, and they bring with them a lifetime of economic benefits. They are more likely to start businesses, and they are more likely to send their children to local schools.<br><br>Seniors are also an important part of the community, and they can benefit from being able to age in place. According to AARP, seniors who live in communities with a wide range of housing options are more likely to be active and engaged, and they are less likely to experience loneliness and isolation.<br><br>Making a case for more affordable housing in Calais is not only the right thing to do, it is also good for the economy and the community as a whole.<p>
