There are many ways to provide affordable housing, but one of the most effective is through the use of Community Land Trusts (CLTs).<br><br>CLTs are a type of nonprofit organization that acquires and manages land for the benefit of the community. The land is then used to provide affordable housing, often through the development of affordable housing units or the sale of land to qualified buyers who agree to keep the units affordable.<br><br>CLTs have been shown to be an effective way to provide affordable housing in a number of ways. First, they help to ensure that land is available for affordable housing developments. Second, they help to keep the cost of housing affordable by holding down the price of land. Third, they help to ensure that affordable housing developments are well-maintained and of high quality.<br><br>The Keokuk Housing Authority has been working with a number of partners to develop a CLT for the city. The goal is to create a CLT that will be able to acquire and manage land for the purpose of providing affordable housing. The CLT will also work with developers to ensure that new affordable housing developments are built in a way that is consistent with the city’s comprehensive plan.<br><br>The Housing Authority is currently working on a feasibility study to determine the best way to move forward with the development of the CLT. Once the feasibility study is complete, the Housing Authority will work with the City Council and other partners to finalize the formation of the CLT.<br><br>The development of a CLT is just one way that the City of Keokuk is working to create more affordable housing options for its residents. The City is also considering a number of other initiatives, including the development of an inclusionary zoning ordinance and the creation of a housing trust fund. These initiatives will help to ensure that Keokuk is a place where everyone can afford to live.<p>
