Low-income residents are being forced to live in substandard housing, or even on the streets, while middle- and upper-income residents are moving to neighboring communities. This is creating a class divide within Clay Center that is damaging the city's social fabric.<br><br>The issue of affordable housing is complex, and there is no easy solution. However, city leaders and residents need to work together to find a way to address the issue.
