If the landlord isn't willing to budge on the rent price, see if there are any other ways you can save money. For example, ask if they're willing to waive the security deposit or include utilities in the rent price. <br><br>4. Finally, if you're still struggling to find an affordable place, you can try looking for government-subsidized housing.
