A study by the National Institutes of Health found that "living in affordable, safe, and well-maintained housing can have a profound impact on health, particularly for children and families." The study found that "poor housing can lead to a host of health problems, including asthma, injuries, stress, anxiety, depression, and obesity." <br><br>In addition, affordable housing can help to improve educational outcomes. A study by the Brookings Institution found that "children in families that move from public housing into less poverty-concentrated neighborhoods have significantly higher math and reading test scores, on average, than similar children who do not move." The study also found that "these effects are largest for children who move before they turn 13." <br><br>Overall, affordable housing can have a positive impact on individuals, families, and communities.<p><h2> Why Jetmore, Kansas is a great place to find affordable housing</h2><p><br><br>Looking for affordable housing?
