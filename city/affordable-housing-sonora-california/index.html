The average rent for a one-bedroom apartment in Sonora is now $1,000, up from $800 just a few years ago. This increase in rent prices is due to a number of factors, including the influx of new residents to the area and the limited availability of rental units.<br><br>As more and more people move to Sonora in search of affordable housing, the demand for rental units has increased. However, the number of available units has not kept pace with this demand, resulting in higher rents. In addition, many of the new residents are employed by the growing number of businesses in the area, which has helped to drive up the cost of living.<br><br>While the rising cost of rent may be a burden for some, it is also a sign of the thriving economy in Sonora. The town has seen a recent boom in population and job growth, and this is only expected to continue in the coming years.

The median rent for a two-bedroom apartment in the city is now $1,280, which is unaffordable for many families.<br><br>The problem is exacerbated by the fact that Sonora is located in a rural area, which means there are few public transportation options and few job opportunities. This makes it difficult for people to find work, and it makes it difficult for them to afford housing.<br><br>There are some affordable housing options available in Sonora, but they are few and far between. If you're looking for affordable housing in the area, you may have to look outside of the city limits.<p>
