In the past year, the authority has completed construction on two new developments, Northrop Place and Southside Manor, which will provide a total of 48 new units of housing. In addition, the authority has also been working on the rehabilitation of an existing development, Maplewood Heights, which will add an additional 24 units of housing.<br><br>The Northrop Place development is a new construction project that consists of 24 two-bedroom units.

Berea is a town with a rich history and a strong sense of community. It is also a town with a high poverty rate and a lack of affordable housing.<br><br>The issue of affordable housing in Berea came to a head in 2015 when the town's only homeless shelter closed.

When housing is unaffordable, families are forced to move constantly, which can disrupt a child's education and make it difficult for parents to hold down a job.<br><br>Second, affordable housing is good for the economy. When families can't afford housing, they are forced to spend less money in the local economy. This can lead to a decline in business and a loss of jobs.<br><br>Third, affordable housing is good for the community. When families are stable and have a place to call home, they are more likely to be involved in their community. They are also more likely to support local businesses and contribute to the local economy.<br><br>The impact of affordable housing in Berea is clear. It is essential for families, good for the economy, and good for the community. Berea needs more affordable housing, and it needs it now.<p>
