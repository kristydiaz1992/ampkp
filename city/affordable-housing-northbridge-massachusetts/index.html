The credit is administered by state and local housing agencies and allows developers to receive a tax credit for a portion of the cost of developing and constructing low-income housing. <br><br>The LIHTC was created in 1986 as a part of the Tax Reform Act and has been used to finance the construction or rehabilitation of over 3 million housing units nationwide. The credit is allotted to states on a per capita basis and then allocated to housing developments by state and local housing agencies. <br><br>Developers who receive the credit must comply with certain requirements, such as setting aside a certain percentage of units for low-income households and maintaining affordability restrictions for a set period of time. In exchange for complying with these requirements, developers receive a tax credit that can be used to offset the cost of construction or rehabilitation. <br><br>The LIHTC has been instrumental in increasing the supply of affordable housing nationwide. It has helped to finance the construction of thousands of housing units for low-income households and has had a positive impact on the lives of millions of Americans.<p>
