      <h2>5 ways to make affordable housing more available in Dodge Center</h2><p><br>There is no one-size-fits-all answer to the question of how to make affordable housing more available in Dodge Center, but here are five possible approaches:<br><br>1. Incentivize development of affordable housing.<br><br>One way to make affordable housing more available is to offer incentives to developers who build it.

Such incentives could help offset the higher costs associated with building affordable housing, making it more financially viable for developers.<br><br>2. Require inclusionary zoning.<br><br>Inclusionary zoning is a planning tool that requires a certain percentage of units in new developments to be set aside as affordable housing. This can help to ensure that a mix of incomes are able to live in a given community, and can be an effective way to increase the stock of affordable housing.<br><br>3. Make use of public land.<br><br>Another option is to make use of public land for the development of affordable housing. This could involve partnering with developers to build affordable housing on city-owned land, or using eminent domain to acquire private land for affordable housing development.<br><br>4. Create a community land trust.<br><br>A community land trust is a nonprofit organization that owns and manages land for the benefit of the community. One way a land trust could help increase the availability of affordable housing is by developing and managing affordable housing developments.<br><br>5. Increase funding for affordable housing.<br><br>One final way to make affordable housing more available is to increase funding for affordable housing initiatives.
