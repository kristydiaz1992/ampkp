The project was launched in 2015, and it's already helped more than 30 families purchase homes in Flat Rock.<br><br>The homes are available to families who make 80% or less of the area median income, and they're priced at just $110,000. That's an incredible bargain in a state like Michigan, where the median home price is more than $200,000.<br><br>The town is also working to create more affordable rental housing options.
