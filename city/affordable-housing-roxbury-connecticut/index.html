According to a report from the National Low Income Housing Coalition, a family earning the median income in the state would need to work 79 hours per week to afford a two-bedroom apartment at the fair market rent.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing can have a ripple effect on the entire community. When families are forced to spend a disproportionate amount of their income on housing, they have less money to spend on other essentials like food, child care, and transportation. This can lead to increased poverty and inequality, as well as a host of other social and economic problems.<br><br>One way to address the affordable housing crisis is through inclusionary zoning, which requires developers to set aside a certain percentage of units for low- and moderate-income households. This policy has been effective in other parts of the country, but it faces some challenges in Roxbury.<br><br>For one, there’s a lack of available land for new development. Roxbury is a densely-populated neighborhood, and there’s simply not a lot of space for new construction. This scarcity of land drives up the cost of development, which makes it difficult to build projects that include a significant number of affordable units.<br><br>In addition, many of the existing housing stock in Roxbury is old and in need of repair. This means that even if a developer wanted to set aside units for low-income residents, the units might not be up to code or safe to live in.
