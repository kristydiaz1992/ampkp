      <h2> How affordable housing is making a positive impact in Saint Joseph.</h2><p><br>There are a number of ways that affordable housing is making a positive impact in Saint Joseph. One of the most important ways is that it is helping to create more inclusive and diverse communities.

The $9.5 million project was completed in 2017, and has been fully leased since opening.<br><br>The city has also worked to improve its existing housing stock. In 2018, the city invested $1.2 million to renovate the Mark Twain Towers, an affordable housing complex for seniors.

One is the high cost of living in the city.

However, there are a number of factors that will shape the future of affordable housing in our city.<br><br>One of the most important factors is the overall health of the economy. A strong economy will create more jobs and higher wages, which will in turn lead to more people being able to afford housing. Conversely, a weak economy will put downward pressure on housing prices and make it more difficult for people to find affordable housing.<br><br>Another important factor is the availability of land and construction materials. If land and construction materials become more expensive, then the cost of building new housing will go up, making it more difficult to provide affordable housing.<br><br>Finally, government policies and regulations related to housing will also play a role in shaping the future of affordable housing in Saint Joseph. For example, if the government increases funding for affordable housing initiatives or implements new regulations that make it easier to build affordable housing, then we are likely to see an increase in the availability of affordable housing. Conversely, if the government cuts funding for affordable housing or makes it more difficult to build affordable housing, then the availability of affordable housing is likely to decrease.<p><h2> How to make the most of affordable housing in Saint Joseph.</h2><p><br>There are many ways to make the most of affordable housing in Saint Joseph.
