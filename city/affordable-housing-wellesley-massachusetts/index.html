      <h2>The town of Wellesley is working to increase affordable housing options for residents.</h2><p><br>The town of Wellesley is working to increase affordable housing options for residents. In order to do this, the town is partnering with local organizations to create more affordable housing units. This will help to ensure that residents can live in Wellesley regardless of their income. The town is also working to create a Community Land Trust, which will help to keep housing affordable in perpetuity.<p><h2>The town of Wellesley is exploring different ways to create more affordable housing.</h2><p><br>The town of Wellesley is exploring different ways to create more affordable housing. One option that is being considered is allowing accessory dwelling units (ADUs) in town. ADUs are small, secondary dwellings on a property that can be used for housing, office space, or other purposes. They are typically separate from the primary dwelling unit on the property, and can be attached or detached.<br><br>Wellesley’s Planning Board is currently studying the issue of ADUs and will be holding public hearings on the matter in the coming months. If you are interested in learning more about this issue, or sharing your thoughts with the Planning Board, please attend one of the public hearings or reach out to the Planning Department.<p><h2>Affordable housing options in Wellesley – what’s available and what’s coming soon.</h2><p><br>There’s no doubt that Wellesley is a desirable place to live. <br><br>The town is consistently ranked as one of the best places to live in Massachusetts, and for good reason. Wellesley is home to top-rated public schools, a lively downtown area, and plenty of green space. <br><br>But one downside of living in such a desirable town is the high cost of housing. According to Zillow, the median home value in Wellesley is $1,313,700. <br><br>If you’re looking for affordable housing options in Wellesley, here’s what’s available and what’s coming soon. <br><br>The Wellesley Housing Authority owns and manages several affordable housing developments in town. There are currently waiting lists for all of these developments, but you can submit your name for the waiting list online. <br><br>In addition, the Wellesley Affordable Housing Trust is working to develop more affordable housing in town. The trust is currently in the process of developing two new affordable housing developments, both of which are expected to be completed in 2020. <br><br>If you’re looking for an affordable place to live in Wellesley, there are options available. It may take some time to get into an affordable housing development, but it’s worth putting your name on the waiting list. And, more affordable housing is on the way.<p><h2>How the town of Wellesley is working to ensure all residents have access to quality, affordable housing.</h2><p><br>The town of Wellesley is committed to ensuring all residents have access to quality, affordable housing. The town has created a Housing Partnership Fund to help provide financing for affordable housing initiatives. The town is also working with the Massachusetts Department of Housing and Community Development to create more affordable housing units. In addition, the town is working with private developers to create mixed-income housing developments.<p><h2>Why affordable housing is important for the town of Wellesley and its residents.</h2><p><br><br>According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, a household is considered to be rent-burdened when it spends more than 30 percent of its income on rent and utilities. In Wellesley, the median rent for a two-bedroom apartment is $2,700, which means a household would need to earn at least $90,000 annually to avoid being rent-burdened. However, the median household income in Wellesley is just $85,256. This means that many Wellesley residents are already struggling to make ends meet, and are one unexpected expense away from falling into homelessness.<br><br>Affordable housing is important for the town of Wellesley because it provides stability for families and individuals who are struggling to make ends meet. When people have a safe and affordable place to live, they are able to focus on other aspects of their lives, like their education and their careers. Additionally, stable housing is linked to better health outcomes, and can help to break the cycle of poverty.<br><br>Wellesley residents who are struggling to find affordable housing have a few options, including the Wellesley Housing Authority and the Wellesley Affordable Housing Trust. The Wellesley Housing Authority manages several affordable housing developments in town, and offers a variety of programs to help low- and moderate-income residents find safe and affordable housing. The Wellesley Affordable Housing Trust is a non-profit organization that works to create and preserve affordable housing in Wellesley. The Trust offers a rental assistance program, which provides financial assistance to eligible households.<br><br>If you are a Wellesley resident who is struggling to find affordable housing, there are resources available to help you. Contact the Wellesley Housing Authority or the Wellesley Affordable Housing Trust to learn more about your options.<p>
