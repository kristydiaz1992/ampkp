I grew up in a working class family and we always struggled to make ends meet. My parents were never able to buy a home of their own and we always had to rent. I remember how hard it was to find a decent place to live that we could afford.

The city has approved a plan that will set aside $1 million to create an Affordable Housing Fund. This fund will provide loans and grants to developers who are working to create more affordable housing in the city.<br><br>This is a great first step. But, there is still more work to be done. The city needs to make sure that this money is used wisely and that it actually goes to help those who need it the most. The city also needs to create more incentives for developers to create affordable housing. But, overall, this is a good first step in the right direction.<br><br>I commend the city of Crawfordville for taking this action. I hope that other cities will follow suit and that we can finally start to address the affordable housing crisis in this country.<p>
