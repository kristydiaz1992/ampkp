The development will include both single-family homes and multi-family units, and it is slated to be completed in 2020.<br><br>This new development is a welcome addition to the city, as the current stock of affordable housing is insufficient to meet the needs of Villa Grove residents. In the past, the city has struggled to attract and retain businesses due to the lack of affordable housing options. With the completion of this new development, Villa Grove will be better positioned to attract and retain businesses, which will in turn create more jobs and further grow the economy.<br><br>The future of affordable housing in Villa Grove looks bright, and the city is on the right track to meeting the needs of its residents.<p>
