This is especially true in larger cities where the cost of housing is skyrocketing.<br><br>One solution to this problem is affordable housing. Affordable housing developments are popping up in many cities across the country, including Portage. But what exactly is affordable housing? And what are the pros and cons of affordable housing?<br><br>The definition of affordable housing varies depending on who you ask. Generally, affordable housing is housing that is considered to be within the financial reach of a household earning a certain amount of money. This income level is typically 80% or less of the median income in an area.<br><br>So, what are the pros of affordable housing? One of the biggest pros is that it can help to alleviate the housing crisis that many cities are currently facing. By providing housing that is more affordable, people are able to find a place to live that they can actually afford.<br><br>Another pro of affordable housing is that it can help to create more diverse and inclusive communities. When people of all income levels are able to live in the same community, it can help to break down barriers and create a more understanding and tolerant society.<br><br>However, there are also some cons to affordable housing. One of the biggest cons is that it can lead to gentrification. Gentrification is when an area becomes more affluent and the original residents are pushed out. This can happen when developers build new affordable housing developments in an area and the original residents can no longer afford to live there.<br><br>Another con of affordable housing is that it can sometimes be of lower quality than market-rate housing. This is because developers may cut corners in order to keep costs down. This can lead to problems with the quality of the housing, such as poor insulation, water leaks, and other issues.<br><br>Overall, there are both pros and cons to affordable housing. It is important to weigh all of the factors before making a decision about whether or not affordable housing is right for you.<p><h2>Why Affordable Housing is Important in Portage</h2><p><br>There are many reasons why affordable housing is important in Portage.
