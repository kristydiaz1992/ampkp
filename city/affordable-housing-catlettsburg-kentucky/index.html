The town is located in Boyd County, which has a poverty rate of 18.8 percent. Despite its small size, Catlettsburg has a large number of affordable housing options. There are several government-funded housing programs that provide low-cost or free housing to eligible residents. These programs have a significant impact on the local economy.<br><br>The most obvious way that affordable housing affects the economy is through the construction and maintenance of the units themselves. The construction of new affordable housing units creates jobs for builders, electricians, plumbers, and other construction workers. The ongoing maintenance of these units also requires the services of janitors, landscapers, and other maintenance workers. These jobs provide income for residents and help to support the local economy.<br><br>Beyond the direct impact of construction and maintenance, affordable housing also has a indirect impact on the economy. When residents have stable, affordable housing, they are more likely to be employed and to have higher incomes. They are also more likely to be able to save money and to invest in their own businesses. The presence of affordable housing therefore helps to create a more prosperous and vibrant local economy.<br><br>Catlettsburg's affordable housing options have had a positive impact on the local economy.
