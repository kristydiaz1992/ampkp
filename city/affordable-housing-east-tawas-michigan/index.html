The median home price in the city has increased by nearly 10% over the past year, and rent prices have increased even more. This is putting a strain on many residents, especially those who are low-income or fixed-income.<br><br>There are a number of factors driving the increase in housing costs in East Tawas. The first is that the city is located in a desirable area. The Great Lakes region is a popular destination for tourists, and East Tawas is a convenient base for exploring the area.

There is not a lot of land available for new development, and the existing housing stock is not being replaced at a fast enough rate to keep up with demand. This is resulting in rising prices for both rental properties and homes for sale.<br><br>The city is working on a number of initiatives to address the affordable housing crisis. The first is a new ordinance that requires developers to set aside a certain percentage of units in new developments for low- and moderate-income residents. The city is also working on a rental assistance program that will help low-income residents with their rent payments.<br><br>Despite these efforts, the affordable housing crisis in East Tawas is likely to continue. The best way to address the problem is to build more housing units, but that is easier said than done. In the meantime, the city is working on programs that will help residents with the increased costs.<p><h2> The impact of affordable housing on the East Tawas, Michigan community</h2><p><br>The East Tawas, Michigan community has been profoundly affected by the lack of affordable housing.
