      <h2>Strategies for affordable housing in Del Norte</h2><p><br>There is a huge demand for affordable housing in Del Norte County, and the issue has been exacerbated by the recent wildfires. The good news is that there are a number of strategies that can be used to create more affordable housing options in the county.<br><br>One strategy is to create incentives for developers to build more affordable housing. This can be done by offering tax breaks or other financial incentives. Another strategy is to loosen zoning regulations to allow for more density. This would make it easier for developers to build multi-unit housing developments, which would in turn make housing more affordable.<br><br>Another strategy is to create community land trusts. This would allow for the development of permanently affordable housing, as the land would be owned by a trust rather than an individual.<br><br>Finally, it is important to create a coordinated effort to create affordable housing. This means that all levels of government, as well as non-profit organizations and private developers, need to be working together towards this goal. By taking a coordinated and collaborative approach, Del Norte County can make significant progress in addressing the affordable housing crisis.<p><h2>Low income housing options in Del Norte</h2><p><br>There are several low income housing options in Del Norte County.
