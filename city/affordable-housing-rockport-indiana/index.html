      <h2> The Importance of Affordable Housing</h2><p><br>The high cost of housing is one of the biggest problems facing low- and moderate-income families in the United States. According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, a family with one full-time worker earning the minimum wage cannot afford the rent for a two-bedroom apartment in any state in the country.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing has serious consequences for families and for the economy as a whole. When families spend too much on housing, they have less money to spend on other necessities like food, child care, and transportation. This can lead to poor health and nutrition, and can make it difficult for children to do well in school.<br><br>The high cost of housing also makes it difficult for businesses to attract and retain workers. Employees who can't afford to live near their job are more likely to quit, and businesses have to spend more on recruiting and training new employees.<br><br>There are a number of ways to make housing more affordable, including increasing funding for affordable housing initiatives, reforming zoning laws, and creating incentives for developers to build more affordable housing.<br><br>Making housing more affordable is essential to ensuring that families can thrive and businesses can prosper. It's time for our leaders to take action on this critical issue.<p><h2> How to Find Affordable Housing in Rockport</h2><p><br>Looking for affordable housing in Rockport?
