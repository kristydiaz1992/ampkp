You may also want to contact a local real estate agent to see if they know of any rentals that might fit your budget.<br><br>Finally, don't forget to consider other factors that can affect your housing costs, such as utilities and transportation.

Look for government programs: There are sometimes programs available that can help you with the down payment or closing costs on a home. Check with your local government to see what might be available.<br><br>4. Consider a co-op: A co-op is a type of ownership where you purchase shares in a corporation that owns the property.

This can be a great way to reduce the cost of living while still enjoying your own space.<br><br>Whatever option you choose, make sure to do your research and talk to a real estate agent to see what might work best for you.
