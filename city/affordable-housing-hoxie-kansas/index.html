      <h2>Hoxie City Council approves affordable housing development</h2><p><br>The Hoxie City Council has approved a new affordable housing development that will provide much-needed homes for low- and moderate-income families. The development, located on the city's north side, will consist of 50 units, with 40 of those units being set aside for families earning 60% or less of the area median income.<br><br>The remaining 10 units will be available for families earning up to 80% of the area median income. The development will also include a community room, laundry facilities, and a playground. Construction is expected to begin later this year and be completed by early 2022.<br><br>This development is a much-needed addition to Hoxie, as the city has a limited supply of affordable housing. According to a study conducted by the city, there is a need for approximately 400 new units of affordable housing. This development will help to address that need, and provide families with safe, decent, and affordable homes.<p><h2>Affordable Housing waiting list grows in Hoxie</h2><p><br>According to a recent report, the waiting list for affordable housing in Hoxie has grown significantly in recent years. In fact, the waiting list is now longer than it was just two years ago.<br><br>This is troubling news for many families in Hoxie who are struggling to make ends meet. The rising cost of housing is one of the biggest factors contributing to the growing inequality in our society.<br><br>As the gap between the rich and the poor continues to widen, it is becoming increasingly difficult for families to find affordable housing. In Hoxie, the waitlist for affordable housing has more than doubled in the past two years.<br><br>There are many factors contributing to the growing problem of housing insecurity in Hoxie. The lack of affordable housing is one of the biggest factors.<br><br>In Hoxie, the average rent for a two-bedroom apartment is $865. This is far out of reach for many families who are struggling to make ends meet.<br><br>The minimum wage in Arkansas is $8.50 an hour. In order to afford the rent for a two-bedroom apartment, a family would need to earn at least $17 an hour.<br><br>However, the average wage in Hoxie is only $11.50 an hour. This means that many families are working hard but still cannot afford to pay their rent.<br><br>The rising cost of living is not the only factor contributing to the growing problem of housing insecurity. The loss of manufacturing jobs has also played a role.<br><br>In the past, many families in Hoxie were able to live comfortably on one income. However, this is no longer the case.<br><br>As manufacturing jobs have left the area, families have been forced to rely on two incomes just to get by. This has put a strain on many families and has made it difficult to afford housing.<br><br>The problem of housing insecurity is not going away anytime soon. The waiting list for affordable housing is only going to grow.<br><br>It is important that we find ways to address this problem. We need to find ways to make housing more affordable for families in Hoxie.<p><h2>Hoxie Housing Authority provides affordable housing for low</h2><p>- income families in Hoxie, Arkansas.<br><br>The Hoxie Housing Authority is committed to providing affordable housing for low-income families in Hoxie, Arkansas.

There are a few different options available to you when it comes to increasing your income, so take a look around and see what might be the best fit for you.<p><h2>Affordable Housing complex to be built in Hoxie</h2><p><br>The city of Hoxie, Arkansas is set to receive a new affordable housing complex, which will be built by the J.A.R. Development Group. The complex, which will be located on the city's south side, will consist of 48 units that will be available to low- and moderate-income residents.<br><br>The project is set to begin construction in the spring of 2020 and will be completed within 18 months. The total cost of the project is estimated to be $6.5 million.<br><br>The development group has stated that the complex will be designed to be "aesthetically pleasing" and will include a variety of amenities for residents, such as a playground, a community room, and a fitness center.<br><br>This project is just one of many that the J.A.R. Development Group has undertaken in recent years to help improve the availability of affordable housing in the state of Arkansas. The group has also built similar complexes in the cities of Little Rock and North Little Rock.<p><h2>Hoxie residents rally for more affordable housing options</h2><p><br>Hoxie residents are tired of being priced out of their own town.<br><br>They’re fed up with watching their neighbors get pushed out by rising rents and property taxes.<br><br>And they’re done with city leaders who they say have ignored their pleas for help.<br><br>So on Tuesday night, more than 100 Hoxie residents packed into the City Council chambers to demand action on affordable housing.<br><br>“We’re here to say enough is enough,” said resident Carla Dobbins. “We need more affordable housing options in Hoxie, and we need them now.”<br><br>Dobbins is part of a new group called Housing for All Hoxie, which formed earlier this year to push for more affordable housing options in the city.<br><br>The group is calling on the city to adopt a “housing trust fund” that would create a dedicated source of funding for affordable housing initiatives.<br><br>They’re also asking the city to allow more density in residential areas, and to create incentives for developers to build more affordable housing.<br><br>“We know what the problem is, and we know what the solutions are,” said Dobbins. “Now we just need our city leaders to have the courage to do something about it.”<br><br>City leaders say they’re aware of the problem and are working on solutions.<br><br>“Affordable housing is a top priority for this council,” said Mayor Jimmie Tramel. “We’re working on a number of initiatives that we hope will make a difference.”<br><br>Tramel said the city is in the process of updating its zoning code to allow more density in residential areas.<br><br>And he said the city is working with a local nonprofit to create a “housing trust fund” that would provide funding for affordable housing initiatives.<br><br>“We know this is a problem, and we’re working on solutions,” said Tramel. “But it’s going to take time.”<br><br>In the meantime, Dobbins says she and other members of Housing for All Hoxie will continue to pressure city leaders to do more.<br><br>“We’re not going away,” she said. “We’ll keep coming to these meetings and we’ll keep making our voices heard until we see some real action on this issue.”<p><h2>Hoxie Affordable Housing Task Force meets to discuss solutions</h2><p><br><br>The Hoxie Affordable Housing Task Force met on Tuesday to discuss possible solutions to the city's affordable housing crisis. The task force, which is made up of city officials, housing experts, and community members, brainstormed a variety of ideas, including increasing the availability of affordable housing, creating more incentives for developers to build affordable housing, and working with the private sector to create more affordable housing options.<br><br>The task force also discussed the possibility of creating a dedicated funding source for affordable housing, which could come from a variety of sources, including the city's general fund, federal and state grants, or private donations. The group also discussed the need for more data on the city's housing needs, which will help them develop more targeted solutions.<br><br>The task force is expected to meet again in the coming weeks to continue their work.<p>
