Below, we dispel some of these myths:<br><br>Myth 1: Affordable housing is only for low-income people<br><br>This is not true! While many affordable housing programs are designed for low-income households, there are also many programs that serve moderate-income households. In fact, some programs are even available to people who are above the low-income threshold.<br><br>Myth 2: Affordable housing is only for people with special needs<br><br>Again, this is not true! While many affordable housing programs do target people with special needs, such as the elderly, disabled, or homeless, there are also many programs that are open to anyone who meets the income requirements.<br><br>Myth 3: Affordable housing is only for renters<br><br>Wrong! There are affordable housing programs available for both renters and homeowners. Whether you’re looking to rent or buy, there are options available to you.<br><br>Myth 4: Affordable housing is only for new construction<br><br>Not necessarily! While many affordable housing units are newly constructed, there are also many units that have been rehabilitated from older buildings.<br><br>Myth 5: Affordable housing is only available in urban areas<br><br>This is not the case! Affordable housing can be found in both rural and urban areas. There are many programs that specifically target rural areas, so don’t assume that affordable housing isn’t an option for you just because you live in a rural area.<p><h2>How to Qualify for Affordable Housing in Maryland</h2><p><br>If you’re looking for affordable housing in Maryland, you may be wondering how to qualify. There are a few different ways to qualify for affordable housing, and each has its own set of requirements.<br><br>To qualify for affordable housing, you must first meet the income requirements.

To qualify for affordable housing, your household income must be at or below 80% of the median income.<br><br>In addition to income requirements, you must also meet the asset limit. In Maryland, the asset limit for affordable housing is $5,000.

Once you have submitted your application, you will be placed on a waiting list.<br><br>The waiting list for affordable housing can be long, so it’s important to be patient.
