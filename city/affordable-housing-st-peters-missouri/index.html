      <h2>St. Louis County provides $1 million for first</h2><p> responders<br><br>St. Louis County is providing $1 million for first responders who are working to keep the community safe. The funds will be used to provide training, equipment, and resources to first responders. This is a great way to show support for the men and women who put their lives on the line every day.<p><h2>time home buyers in north county</h2><p><br>Are you a first time home buyer in North County? Congratulations! Purchasing a home is a huge milestone in your life.<br><br>There are a few things you should know before beginning the home buying process. First, you need to get pre-approved for a mortgage. This will give you an idea of how much money you can borrow and what kind of interest rate you can expect to pay.<br><br>Next, start searching for your dream home! Once you find a few homes that you like, be sure to have a professional home inspector take a look at the property. This is an important step in order to make sure that the home is in good condition and doesn’t have any hidden problems.<br><br> Lastly, be prepared to negotiate with the seller. If you have your finances in order and you’re pre-approved for a mortgage, you’ll be in a good position to negotiate a fair price for the home.<br><br>If you have any questions or need help getting started, please contact me. I’d be happy to assist you in any way possible.<p><h2>City of St. Charles to provide $5,000 grants for down payment assistance</h2><p><br>The City of St. Charles is committed to helping its residents achieve the dream of homeownership. To that end, the City is providing $5,000 grants for down payment assistance to income-eligible buyers who purchase a home within the City limits.<br><br>The program is open to anyone who meets the income guidelines and who is looking to purchase a home in St. Charles. The grant money can be used for down payment assistance, closing costs, or other related expenses.<br><br>If you are interested in learning more about this program, or if you are interested in purchasing a home in St. Charles, please contact the City of St. Charles Housing Division at 636-949-3237.<p><h2>St. Peters Mayor Tim Hutchison talks affordable housing, flooding and the future</h2><p><br>St. Peters Mayor Tim Hutchison is committed to making his city a great place to live for all residents.

He is committed to continuing to improve the city and make it a place that everyone can call home.<p><h2>The effects of the new tax bill on affordable housing in St. Louis</h2><p><br>The new tax bill could have a major impact on affordable housing in St. Louis. The bill includes a number of provisions that could make it more difficult for low- and middle-income families to afford a place to live.<br><br>One of the most significant changes is the elimination of the deduction for state and local taxes. This could lead to a decrease in funding for affordable housing programs that are supported by state and local taxes.<br><br>Another change that could affect affordable housing is the reduction in the mortgage interest deduction. This could make it more difficult for families to afford a home, and could lead to more foreclosures.<br><br>The new tax bill could also have an impact on the funding for Section 8 housing vouchers. The bill includes a provision that would cap the amount of money that can be spent on these vouchers, which could lead to a decrease in the number of families that receive them.<br><br>All of these changes could have a major impact on the availability of affordable housing in St. Louis. Families who are already struggling to make ends meet could find themselves even more burdened, and the city could see an increase in homelessness.<p><h2>How to find affordable housing in St. Louis</h2><p><br>Are you looking for affordable housing in St. Louis?

The city's current minimum wage of $7.70 will increase to $10.00 on January 1, 2018. This increase will put more money in the pockets of minimum wage workers, but it will also put a strain on employers and businesses.
