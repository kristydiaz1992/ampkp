According to the 2017 American Community Survey, the median rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Burley is $792 per month, and the median rent for a three-bedroom apartment is $949 per month. That means that a family of four would need to earn at least $3,168 per month to afford a two-bedroom apartment and at least $3,796 per month to afford a three-bedroom apartment.<br><br>There are a number of factors that have contributed to the tight housing market in Burley. First, the population of Burley has been growing rapidly in recent years. Between 2010 and 2017, the city's population grew by 12.7%. This population growth has outpaced the construction of new housing units, which has been slow to keep up. According to the Idaho Department of Labor, Burley had a housing vacancy rate of just 1.3% in 2017.<br><br>Second, the median household income in Burley is relatively low. In 2017, the median household income in Burley was $43,844. That's well below the statewide median of $56,827. This means that many families in Burley simply can't afford to pay market-rate rents.<br><br>The tight housing market in Burley is having a number of negative impacts on the city. First, it's causing rents to rise. This is putting a strain on families who are already struggling to make ends meet. Second, it's making it difficult for businesses to attract and retain employees. This is a particular problem for businesses that rely on low-wage workers, such as restaurants and retail establishments. Finally, the tight housing market is contributing to the city's homeless problem. According to the Idaho Housing and Finance Association, there were nearly 400 homeless people living in Burley in 2017.<br><br>The city of Burley is working to address the affordable housing problem. In 2017, the city adopted an inclusionary zoning ordinance that requires new residential developments to set aside a certain percentage of units for low- and moderate-income households. The city is also working with local nonprofits to provide financial assistance to families who are struggling to pay their rent.<br><br>Despite these efforts, the affordable housing problem in Burley remains a serious challenge. With the population continuing to grow and the median household income remaining relatively low, more needs to be done to ensure that all Burley residents have access to safe and affordable housing.<p><h2> How to make affordable housing work in Burley, Idaho</h2><p><br><br>There is no one-size-fits-all answer to the question of how to make affordable housing work in Burley, Idaho. However, there are some general principles that can help to make affordable housing more successful in this community.<br><br>1. Plan for a mix of housing types and prices.<br><br>Creating a mix of housing types and prices is important for ensuring that there are affordable housing options available for a wide range of households. In Burley, this might mean planning for a mix of single-family homes, apartments, and condos, as well as a variety of price points.<br><br>2. Make use of available land.<br><br>There is a limited amount of land available in Burley, so it is important to make the most of what is available. One way to do this is to build housing developments that include a mix of housing types and prices. Another way to make use of available land is to build multi-story buildings, which can help to maximize the number of units that can be built in a given area.<br><br>3. Take advantage of government programs.<br><br>There are a number of federal, state, and local programs that can help to make housing more affordable. In Burley, Idaho, these programs might include the Low Income Housing Tax Credit program and the HOME Investment Partnerships program. Utilizing these programs can help to make a development more affordable for residents.<br><br>4. Work with the private sector.<br><br>The private sector can be a valuable partner in creating affordable housing. In Burley, this might mean working with developers to create an affordable housing development or partnering with a property management company to help operate an affordable housing community.<br><br>5. Be creative.<br><br>There is no one right way to create affordable housing. It is important to be creative and to think outside the box when it comes to developing housing that is affordable for Burley residents.<p>
