But what exactly is affordable housing? And why is it so important?<br><br>In short, affordable housing is housing that doesn’t cost more than 30% of a household’s income. This can be tricky to achieve, as the average American household spends about 50% of its income on housing.<br><br>There are a number of reasons why affordable housing is so important. For one, it allows families to spend their money on other essentials, like food, clothing, and healthcare. It also allows families to save money for the future and avoid taking on crushing debt.<br><br>But affordable housing is about more than just money. It’s also about stability and opportunity. Families who have stable, affordable housing are more likely to be able to stay in their homes and their neighborhoods for the long term. This stability can lead to better educational outcomes for children and increased economic opportunity for adults.<br><br>In Salisbury, Maryland, affordable housing is an important issue because of the high cost of living in the area. Salisbury is the largest city in Maryland’s Eastern Shore region, and its cost of living is about 15% higher than the national average.<br><br>The median home price in Salisbury is $180,000, which is affordable for some families but out of reach for others. Rent is also high in Salisbury, with the average two-bedroom apartment renting for $1,100 per month.<br><br>There are a number of organizations working to increase the availability of affordable housing in Salisbury. The Salisbury Housing Authority, for example, provides housing for low- and moderate-income families. And the Habitat for Humanity of Wicomico County builds and sells homes to families in need.<br><br>These organizations are helping to make a difference, but there is still more work to be done. If you’re concerned about the issue of affordable housing in Salisbury, there are a number of ways you can get involved. You can donate to or volunteer with one of the organizations mentioned above. You can also advocate for policies that will increase the availability of affordable housing, like inclusionary zoning.<br><br>Affordable housing is important for families and communities all across the country.
