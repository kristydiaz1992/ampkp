Through a Memorandum of Understanding, the City and the Tribe have committed to creating a work group to identify barriers to affordable housing and to work together to find solutions. <br><br>The work group is made up of representatives from the City, the Tribe, Southeast Alaska Housing Corporation, Ketchikan Gateway Borough, Southeast Alaska Regional Health Consortium, and the University of Alaska.

Building materials and labor are both expensive in Alaska, and this drives up the cost of new construction.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing is a problem for the entire community. It makes it difficult for families to stay together, for people to find work, and for children to get a good education.

One is to increase the supply of housing. This can be done through public investment in new construction, or by encouraging private developers to build more housing. Another solution is to provide financial assistance to families who are struggling to pay their rent or mortgage. This could be done through government programs or private charities.<br><br>The issue of affordable housing is complex, and there is no easy solution. However, it is important to address the problem, as it is having a negative impact on the quality of life of many residents of Ketchikan.<p>
