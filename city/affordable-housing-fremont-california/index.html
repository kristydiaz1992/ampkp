This program will provide much-needed financial assistance to eligible businesses that have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.<br><br>The SVOG program will provide grant money to eligible businesses so that they can pay their employees, bills, and other expenses. This will be a huge help to businesses that have been struggling to stay afloat during the pandemic.<br><br>We encourage all eligible businesses to apply for this program.
