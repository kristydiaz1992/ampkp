      <h2>Solutions to the affordable housing crisis in Fort Collins</h2><p><br>The Fort Collins City Council is considering a number of solutions to the affordable housing crisis in the city. One solution is to create a new city-owned affordable housing development near Old Town.

This could include density bonuses, reduced impact fees, or other financial incentives.<br><br>The city is also looking at ways to increase the supply of affordable housing through the use of public land. This could involve partnering with a developer to build an affordable housing project on city-owned land, or making city-owned land available for affordable housing developments.<br><br>The city is also considering changes to its zoning code to allow for more density in mixed-use and residential areas.
