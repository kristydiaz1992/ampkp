      <h2>The Affordable Housing Crisis in Taylorville, Illinois</h2><p><br>The city of Taylorville, Illinois is facing an affordable housing crisis. In 2016, the city had a median home value of $93,400, but the median rent was $685. That means that a family earning the median income of $36,000 would spend nearly two-thirds of their income on rent.<br><br>This is not a new problem for Taylorville. In fact, it is one that has been growing for many years. The number of people living in poverty in the city has increased by nearly 50% since 2000. And as housing costs have continued to rise, more and more families are being priced out of the city.<br><br>There are a number of factors that have contributed to the affordable housing crisis in Taylorville. One is the loss of manufacturing jobs in the city. Over the past few decades, many of the factories that once employed Taylorville residents have closed down. This has led to a decrease in the city's tax base, which has made it difficult to fund affordable housing initiatives.<br><br>Another factor is the rising cost of land in Taylorville. As the city has become more desirable, the cost of land has gone up. This has made it difficult for developers to build new affordable housing developments.<br><br>The affordable housing crisis in Taylorville is having a profound impact on the city's residents.
