      <h2>Lack of affordable housing in Dwight, Nebraska is a problem.</h2><p><br>According to the Nebraska Housing Study, there is a significant lack of affordable housing in Dwight, Nebraska. In fact, only 26% of households in Dwight can afford a modest two-bedroom home. This is a problem because it means that many families are forced to either live in overcrowded conditions or pay a large percentage of their income on housing.

One is the loss of manufacturing jobs in the town. This has led to a decrease in the median income of residents, making it difficult for them to afford housing.

This has made it difficult for developers to build new, affordable housing.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing in Dwight is a serious problem that needs to be addressed. There are a number of ways to do this, including increasing the availability of affordable housing vouchers, providing incentives for developers to build new affordable housing, and increasing the minimum wage.
