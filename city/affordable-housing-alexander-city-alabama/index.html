Alexander City was founded in 1833 as a small trading post on the Alabama River. The city grew quickly, and by the mid-19th century, it was one of the largest cities in the state. The city's economy was booming, and new construction was happening all over. However, most of the new construction was for luxury homes and businesses, leaving little room for working-class families. This problem was compounded by the fact that Alexander City was a segregated city, with white and black residents living in separate areas. This meant that black residents had even fewer options for affordable housing.<br><br>The situation began to improve in the mid-20th century, as the civil rights movement gained momentum and desegregation became the law of the land. Alexander City began to desegregate its housing market, and new affordable housing developments were built to serve the needs of the city's working-class families. However, these developments were not without their problems. Many were poorly designed and built, and they quickly became crime-ridden and rundown.<br><br>The city's affordable housing situation began to improve in the 1990s, as the city's economy began to rebound. New affordable housing developments were built, and existing ones were renovated. Today, Alexander City has a variety of affordable housing options for its residents. There are still some challenges, but the city is working hard to provide safe, decent, and affordable housing for all of its residents.<p><h2> The future of affordable housing in Alexander City</h2><p><br><br>There is no doubt that the future of affordable housing in Alexander City looks bright. The city has recently been named one of the top 10 "Best Places to Live in Alabama" by Movoto, and it is clear that the city's commitment to providing quality affordable housing is a major reason why.<br><br>In the past few years, Alexander City has made great strides in improving its affordable housing stock. The city has invested millions of dollars into redeveloping aging public housing complexes, and has also worked to create new affordable housing options through initiatives like the Alexander City Housing Authority's Homeownership Program.<br><br>Looking ahead, Alexander City appears poised to continue its progress in making quality affordable housing available to all residents. The city's commitment to this issue is evident in its recent adoption of an Affordable Housing Plan, which sets forth a clear roadmap for how the city will continue to invest in and improve its affordable housing stock. With strong leadership and a commitment to its citizens, there is no doubt that Alexander City will continue to be a great place to live for all.<p>
