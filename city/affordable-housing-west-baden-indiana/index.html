The town has been working with the Indiana Housing and Community Development Authority (IHCDA) to create an Affordable Housing Task Force. The task force is made up of community members, business leaders, and government officials. They're working together to identify ways to make sure everyone in the town has a safe and affordable place to live. <br><br>One of the task force's first projects is to create a new Housing Assistance Program.

Today, it’s a landmark destination for affordable housing.<br><br>The West Baden Springs Hotel, located in West Baden, Indiana, was built in 1902. The hotel was designed by architect Harrison Albright and was inspired by the Roman baths in Baden-Baden, Germany. The hotel cost $2.5 million to build and featured six hundred guest rooms, a massive atrium, and a six-story dome. The hotel was a destination for the wealthy and famous and was frequented by celebrities such as Charlie Chaplin, Babe Ruth, and Al Capone.<br><br>In the late 1990s, the hotel fell into disrepair and was closed. The hotel was purchased by the West Baden Springs Redevelopment Commission in 2001 and was renovated. The renovation cost $47 million and took four years to complete. The hotel reopened in 2005 and now features ninety-nine affordable housing units.<br><br>The units are available to low- and moderate-income families and are reserved for those who work in the hotel or in the nearby French Lick Resort. The units are income-based and range in price from $500 to $850 per month.<br><br>The affordable housing units have changed the landscape of West Baden. The hotel is no longer a destination for the wealthy and famous, but it is now a destination for families who are looking for affordable housing.

The town is committed to working with developers and builders to create new opportunities for residents to find quality, affordable homes.<br><br>One of the most promising developments on the horizon is the proposed redevelopment of the former West Baden Springs Hotel. This project has the potential to create dozens of new affordable housing units, as well as new retail and commercial space.<br><br>The town is also exploring other ways to create more affordable housing, including working with nonprofit organizations and state and federal programs. Whatever the future holds, West Baden is committed to ensuring that its residents have access to quality, affordable homes.<p>
