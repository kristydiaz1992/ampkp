The village has a population of just over 22,000 people and is a popular destination for families and young professionals. The median home price in Lisle is $339,900, which is significantly higher than the national median home price of $185,900.

This is nearly impossible for many families, particularly those who are struggling to make ends meet.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing in Lisle is having a negative impact on the community. Families are being forced to move out of the village due to the high cost of living, and this is causing the population to decline.

The community has seen an influx of families and individuals who are able to find safe and affordable housing options, which has led to a decrease in crime and an overall increase in the quality of life for residents.

In addition, the average rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Lisle is $1,480, which is well above the national average of $1,087.<br><br>The challenges of affordable housing in Lisle, Illinois are compounded by the fact that the village is located in DuPage County, which has some of the highest property taxes in the state.

One solution is for the village to create a designated fund for affordable housing.<br><br>This fund could be used to provide incentives for developers to build more affordable housing units, or it could be used to directly fund affordable housing initiatives.<br><br>Another solution is for the village to work with local non-profit organizations to create more affordable housing options.
