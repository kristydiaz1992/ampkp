They have created a task force to study the issue and develop solutions. One of the solutions that is being considered is the creation of an affordable housing trust fund. The trust fund would be used to provide financial assistance to developers who build affordable housing.<br><br>The city is also considering changing its zoning laws to allow for more density. This would make it easier for developers to build multi-unit housing, which would be more affordable than single-family homes.<br><br>The future of affordable housing in Maricopa looks promising. The city is taking proactive steps to address the issue and is considering a variety of solutions. With the right policies in place, the city can ensure that everyone has access to safe and affordable housing.<p>
