Additionally, many of the available pieces of land are in less than desirable locations or are too small to build a development that would be beneficial to the community.<br><br>Another challenge is the cost of construction. With the cost of materials and labor continuing to increase, it becomes more difficult to build affordable housing developments that can be sold or rented at a price that is affordable for low- and moderate-income families. Additionally, many of the available financing options for affordable housing developments have become more restrictive, making it difficult to get the funding needed to build the developments.<br><br>The last challenge is the lack of available resources. Many of the affordable housing developments that are available are in need of repairs and updates. However, with the lack of funding, it becomes difficult to make the necessary repairs and updates.

The land would be used for affordable housing, community gardens, and other community-oriented uses.<br><br>These are just a couple of examples of unique solutions to affordable housing in West Bloomfield. There are many other possible solutions, and it will be important to explore all options to find the best fit for the community.<p><h2>What are some successful affordable housing models in other cities that West Bloomfield could learn from?</h2><p><br>There are a number of other cities that have been successful in creating affordable housing models that could be implemented in West Bloomfield.
