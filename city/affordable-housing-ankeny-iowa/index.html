The city's population grew by nearly 20% between 2010 and 2018, and it is projected to continue growing. This growth is largely due to the city's proximity to Des Moines, which is the state capital and largest city in Iowa.<br><br>The rapid growth of Ankeny has led to challenges in providing affordable housing. The city's median home value is $234,000, and the median rent is $1,200. The median income in Ankeny is $70,843, which is higher than the statewide median income of $56,247.<br><br>There are several reasons why housing is unaffordable for many people in Ankeny. First, the city's population growth has outpaced the development of new housing. This has led to increased competition for housing, which has driven up prices. Second, the majority of new housing development in Ankeny has been for luxury homes and apartments, which are out of reach for most residents.<br><br>The city of Ankeny is working to address the challenges of affordable housing. The city has created a task force to study the issue and develop recommendations. The task force is currently working on a housing needs assessment and will make recommendations to the City Council in the fall of 2019.<br><br>In the meantime, there are several things that Ankeny residents can do to find affordable housing. The city's website has a list of resources for finding affordable housing. Additionally, the Iowa Finance Authority offers a program that provides down payment assistance for first-time home buyers.<p><h2> What Does the Future Hold for Affordable Housing in Ankeny, Iowa?</h2><p><br><br>There is no one-size-fits-all answer to the question of what the future holds for affordable housing in Ankeny, Iowa. The needs of the community, the availability of funding, and the overall health of the economy will all play a role in shaping the future of affordable housing in Ankeny.<br><br>That said, there are a few possible scenarios that could play out in Ankeny's affordable housing market in the coming years.<br><br>One possibility is that the demand for affordable housing will continue to increase, as it has in recent years. This could lead to a shortage of affordable housing options, and cause prices to rise.<br><br>Another possibility is that the supply of affordable housing will increase, as more developers build new units to meet the demand. This could help to keep prices down, and provide more options for those who need it.<br><br>Finally, it is also possible that the market for affordable housing will stabilize, with neither an increase or decrease in demand or supply. This would likely lead to stable prices, and provide a more predictable housing market for both developers and renters.<br><br>No matter what the future holds, it is clear that affordable housing will continue to be an important issue in Ankeny, Iowa. The community will need to continue to work together to find solutions that work for everyone.<p>
