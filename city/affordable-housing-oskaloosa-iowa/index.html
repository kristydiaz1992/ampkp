In Oskaloosa, there are several organizations that provide shelter and assistance to those who are homeless, but the demand often exceeds the supply.<br><br>Affordable housing is an important issue for families and individuals in Oskaloosa, and it is one that needs to be addressed.<p><h2>The negative effects of not having affordable housing in Oskaloosa.</h2><p><br>Oskaloosa is a city in Iowa with a population of 11,463.
