According to the most recent data from the U.S. Census Bureau, more than 30% of households in Braintree have an income of less than $50,000.<br><br>The high cost of housing is a major barrier to economic mobility for many families in Braintree. Families who are struggling to make ends meet are often forced to make difficult choices between paying for housing and other basic needs. This can lead to financial insecurity and even homelessness.<br><br>The town of Braintree is working to address the issue of affordable housing. In 2016, the town adopted a comprehensive plan that includes a goal of creating more than 1,000 new units of affordable housing. The town has also created a Housing Trust Fund to help finance the construction of new affordable housing.<br><br>Despite these efforts, the town of Braintree faces a significant challenge in creating enough affordable housing to meet the needs of its residents. The high cost of land and construction make it difficult to build new housing that is affordable for families with low and moderate incomes.<br><br>The town of Braintree is committed to finding solutions to the affordable housing crisis. We urge our elected officials to continue to invest in affordable housing initiatives and to work with the private sector to create more units of affordable housing.

The median home price in Braintree is $520,000, and the median rent is $2,500.

Starting by looking for listings online is a great way to get an idea of what's available in your price range.

Additionally, contacting a real estate agent who specializes in affordable housing can be a helpful way to learn about your options.<p><h2>The importance of affordable housing in Braintree, Massachusetts</h2><p><br><br><br><br>For many people in the United States, the cost of housing is a significant burden. According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, the average fair market rent for a two-bedroom apartment is $1,170 per month. This means that a household would need to earn a wage of $23.40 per hour to afford this rental – which is more than double the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour.<br><br>In Braintree, Massachusetts, the median rent for a two-bedroom apartment is $1,900 per month. This is significantly higher than the national average, and it means that a household would need to earn an hourly wage of $37.50 to afford this rental.<br><br>The high cost of housing in Braintree is a major problem for low- and moderate-income families. According to the Massachusetts Housing Partnership, more than half of all renters in the state are “cost-burdened,” meaning that they spend more than 30 percent of their income on housing. For these families, the high cost of housing leaves little room for other necessities like food, child care, and transportation.<br><br>The high cost of housing is also a barrier to economic opportunity. Families who spend a large portion of their income on housing may have difficulty affording other basic costs of living, let alone investing in their education or starting a small business.<br><br>One way to address the high cost of housing in Braintree is to create more affordable housing options. Affordable housing is housing that is “affordable” to households with low or moderate incomes. In other words, it is housing that does not cost more than 30 percent of a household’s income.<br><br>There are a number of ways to create affordable housing, including government subsidies, zoning changes, and private investment. Creating more affordable housing in Braintree would help to ease the burden on low- and moderate-income families and create more economic opportunity for all.<p>
