The town has a median home value of $275,000, which is significantly higher than the state average of $180,000. The high cost of living is due in part to the lack of affordable housing. There are few options for residents who cannot afford to buy a home, and rents are also very high. The average rent for a one-bedroom apartment in Middleboro is $1,200, which is much higher than the state average of $850.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing is a major problem for families and individuals who are struggling to make ends meet. Many people are forced to live in substandard housing or to move out of town altogether.

The town has created a Housing Trust Fund, which provides funding for affordable housing initiatives. The town is also working with the Housing Authority of Plymouth to create more affordable housing options. However, more needs to be done to make sure that everyone who wants to live in Middleboro can afford to do so.<p><h2> The town of Middleboro's commitment to providing affordable housing</h2><p><br>Middleboro is committed to providing affordable housing for its residents.

The lack of affordable housing options is having a detrimental impact on the quality of life for many residents, and is also putting a strain on the local economy.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing options is forcing many residents to either live in overcrowded and unsafe conditions, or to move out of the community altogether. This is having a negative impact on the quality of life for many residents, and is also damaging the local economy. When residents are forced to move out of the community, they take their spending power with them, which hurts local businesses.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing is also making it difficult for the Middleboro community to attract and retain businesses. Businesses are reluctant to locate or expand in an area where their employees will have difficulty finding housing that they can afford. This is a particular concern in the Middleboro community, which is already struggling to attract and retain businesses.<br><br>The issue of affordable housing is one that needs to be addressed urgently, in order to improve the quality of life for residents and the health of the local economy.<p><h2> The future of affordable housing in Middleboro</h2><p><br><br>As the town of Middleboro continues to grow, the need for affordable housing will become more and more apparent. With the help of the town's Planning Board, the future of affordable housing in Middleboro looks bright.<br><br>The Planning Board has been working diligently to create a new zoning bylaw that would allow for the construction of more affordable housing developments in town. This bylaw would create a new "Affordable Housing Overlay District" which would make it easier for developers to build affordable housing developments that meet the needs of the town's residents.<br><br>The Board is hopeful that this bylaw will be approved by the town's voters at the next town meeting, and that it will help to make Middleboro a more affordable place to live for everyone.<p>
