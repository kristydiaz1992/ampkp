The median price for a home in Monticello is $215,000, which is more than double the national median price of $100,000. The high cost of housing is exacerbated by the fact that Monticello is a small town with a limited supply of housing.

The high cost of housing also makes it difficult for residents to start their own businesses.<br><br>There are a number of reasons why housing is so expensive in Monticello. The first is that the town is located in a rural area. The second is that the town has a limited supply of housing. The third is that the town has a very low median income.<br><br>The first two factors, the location of Monticello and the limited supply of housing, are beyond the control of the town. The third factor, the low median income, is something that the town can do something about. The town can attract new businesses and industries that will create new jobs and raise the median income. The town can also invest in affordable housing initiatives that will help make housing more affordable for residents.<p><h2> The importance of affordable housing in Monticello, Minnesota</h2><p><br><br>There are many factors to consider when thinking about affordable housing in Monticello, Minnesota.

This is nearly double the minimum wage in Minnesota, which is $7.87 per hour. For a single person, the hourly wage needed to afford a one-bedroom apartment is $13.39.<br><br>There are a number of organizations in Monticello working to address the issue of affordable housing.
