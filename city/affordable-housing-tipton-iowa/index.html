The mother said, "This is something we could never have done on our own. It's a dream come true."<br><br>The process of building the home took about a week and a half. A group of about 15 volunteers came together to work on the home. They did everything from framing to painting to putting in the flooring.<br><br>It was a lot of work, but it was worth it. As one of the volunteers said, "It's really rewarding to know that you're making a difference in somebody's life."<br><br>If you're interested in volunteering with Habitat for Humanity, you can visit their website to find out more information.
