I drag myself out of bed, feeling like I've barely slept at all. I get dressed and head downstairs, where I find my mom and little sister already up and getting breakfast ready. We eat together and then head out for the day.<br><br>My mom drops me off at the bus stop and I wave goodbye as she drives away. I wait for the bus, feeling grateful that it's only a short ride to school. I'm not looking forward to another day of classes, but I know I have to push through.<br><br>I get to school and sit through my classes, barely paying attention. I'm tired and my mind keeps wandering. I just want to go home and relax. Finally, the last bell rings and I head out.<br><br>I get home and plop down on the couch, turning on the TV. I veg out for a while, not really paying attention to what's on. I'm starting to get hungry, so I get up and rummage through the kitchen for something to eat. I find a box of cereal and eat it standing up, then head back to the couch.<br><br>I spend the rest of the afternoon and evening watching TV and scrolling through social media. I talk to my friends for a little while and then head to bed. I'm exhausted, but I know I have to do it all over again tomorrow.<p><h2>The history of affordable housing in Belleville, Illinois.</h2><p><br>The first affordable housing project in Belleville, Illinois was built in the early 1970s. The project was called the Belleville Housing Authority and was located on the west side of town. The project was developed by the City of Belleville and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The project was designed to provide safe, decent, and affordable housing for low-income families. The project was a success and helped to improve the quality of life for many families in Belleville.<br><br>The Belleville Housing Authority continued to develop affordable housing projects throughout the city.

The most recent census showed that nearly one-third of Belleville residents are living in poverty, and the number of people who are homeless is on the rise.<br><br>The city has been working hard to try to find solutions to the problem, but so far, nothing has been working. The city has been trying to get more Section 8 housing vouchers, but the waiting list is already so long that it will take years for everyone on the list to get a voucher. The city has also been trying to get more affordable housing developments built, but developers are not interested in building in Belleville because the city does not have the money to provide them with the subsidies they need.<br><br>It is clear that the city of Belleville is in a crisis when it comes to affordable housing.

Otherwise, the city will continue to decline and its residents will suffer.<p><h2>My personal experience with affordable housing in Belleville, Illinois.</h2><p><br><br>When I moved to Belleville, Illinois, I was struck by the number of affordable housing options that were available.

I have been able to take advantage of some of these programs, and I have found them to be very helpful.<br><br>I am grateful to have found affordable housing in Belleville, and I believe that the city's commitment to this issue is commendable.
