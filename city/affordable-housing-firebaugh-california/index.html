It is part of the Fresno–Madera metropolitan area.<br><br>One of the challenges facing Firebaugh is the lack of affordable housing. In a city where the median household income is just over $30,000 a year, many residents are struggling to find housing that they can afford.<br><br>The high cost of housing is due in part to the limited availability of land in Firebaugh. The city is hemmed in by farmland on all sides, making it difficult to annex additional land for new development. This lack of land has helped drive up the price of housing, as there is simply not enough supply to meet the demand.<br><br>Another challenge facing the city is a lack of funding for affordable housing initiatives. While the city has been able to secure some grant funding for such projects in the past, the amount of money available is often not enough to make a significant impact.<br><br>The city is working to address the challenges of affordable housing, but it will take time and effort to make progress. In the meantime, many residents are struggling to find a place to call home.<p>
