The population was 1,591 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Lewiston-Auburn, Maine metropolitan statistical area.<br><br>The town was named for Robert Livermore, an early settler.<br><br>Livermore Falls is home to the Androscoggin Riverlands State Park, a 9,000-acre (3,600 ha) public recreation area on the Androscoggin River.<br><br>The importance of affordable housing in Livermore Falls, Maine cannot be understated. According to the most recent census data, the median household income in Livermore Falls is just over $37,000 per year, and almost 28% of the townâ€™s residents are living below the poverty line. This means that a significant portion of the townâ€™s residents are struggling to make ends meet, and many are likely spending a large percentage of their income on housing costs.<br><br>The townâ€™s affordable housing crisis is exacerbated by the fact that the median home value in Livermore Falls is just over $100,000, which is significantly lower than the statewide median home value of over $200,000. This means that even if a family is able to find an affordable place to live, they are likely to be living in substandard housing.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing in Livermore Falls is having a number of negative consequences for the townâ€™s residents. For one, it is causing many families to move out of town in search of better housing options. This is not only bad for the families who are forced to move, but it also hurts the town as a whole by decreasing the population and the amount of tax revenue that the town receives.<br><br>Additionally, the lack of affordable housing is likely to lead to an increase in homelessness in Livermore Falls. This is because families who are struggling to pay their rent or mortgage are at risk of being evicted, and when they are evicted, they often have nowhere to go but the streets.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing is also having a negative impact on the townâ€™s economy. This is because businesses are less likely to locate in or expand to a town that does not have enough affordable housing for their employees. This means that the lack of affordable housing is likely to lead to a decrease in jobs and an increase in poverty in Livermore Falls.<br><br>The townâ€™s affordable housing crisis is only going to become worse in the future if something is not done to address it. The townâ€™s population is expected to grow in the coming years, and as the population grows, the demand for housing will increase. This will likely lead to an increase in rents and home prices, and unless something is done to increase the supply of affordable housing, many families will be priced out of the town.<br><br>The townâ€™s leaders need to take action to address the affordable housing crisis. This could include working with developers to create new affordable housing developments, providing financial assistance to families who are struggling to pay their rent or mortgage, or creating new zoning regulations that require all new developments to include a certain percentage of affordable units.<br><br>Whatever action is taken, it is important that it is done quickly, as the longer the townâ€™s leaders wait to address the issue, the worse the problem is going to become.<p><h2>The Negative Effects of Unaffordable Housing in Livermore Falls, Maine</h2><p><br><br>Livermore Falls, Maine is a town in Androscoggin County, Maine, United States.
