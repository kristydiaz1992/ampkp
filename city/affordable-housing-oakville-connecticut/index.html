As of the 2016 census, Oakville's population was 193,832.<br><br>Oakville is a prosperous town with a median household income of $118,047. However, it also has a high cost of living, with a median house price of $1,176,094.<br><br>This combination of factors has led to a severe shortage of affordable housing in Oakville. In fact, the town has the lowest vacancy rate for rental properties in the entire Greater Toronto Area (GTA), at just 0.4%.<br><br>This shortage of affordable housing is having a negative impact on the town's residents.

He has set a target of adding 2,000 new affordable housing units in Oakville over the next five years.<br><br>However, some critics say that this is not enough. They point out that the town needs to add 10,000 new units just to keep up with population growth. They also argue that the town should do more to encourage the development of purpose-built rental properties, as these are the most affordable type of housing.<br><br>Whatever the solution, it is clear that something needs to be done to address Oakville's affordable housing crisis.

The strategy includes a number of initiatives, such as the creation of an Affordable Housing Reserve Fund, which will help to create new affordable housing units.<br><br>The town is also working with developers to create mixed-use developments, which will include both commercial and residential space.
