      <h2> The hidden crisis of affordable housing in America's small cities</h2><p><br>There's a hidden crisis brewing in America's small cities.<br><br>As more and more people are priced out of larger urban areas, they're increasingly turning to smaller cities in search of affordable housing. But what they're finding is that even these once-affordable places are becoming increasingly out of reach.<br><br>The problem is especially acute in so-called "second-tier" cities, which have seen a surge in popularity in recent years but haven't kept pace with demand, leading to rapidly rising rents and home prices.<br><br>Take, for example, the city of Asheville, North Carolina. Once a relatively affordable place to live, Asheville is now one of the hottest real estate markets in the country, with median home prices having jumped nearly 20% in just the past year.<br><br>Rents are also on the rise, with the average two-bedroom apartment now going for more than $1,400 per month. That's a far cry from the $600 per month that was typical just a few years ago.<br><br>The situation is similar in other small cities across the country, from Missoula, Montana to Boise, Idaho. And it's putting a tremendous strain on working families and others who are struggling to make ends meet.<br><br>There's no easy solution to this problem, but one thing is clear: America's small cities are in the midst of an affordable housing crisis that is only going to get worse in the years to come.<p><h2> How New Hampshire's lack of affordable housing is affecting its economy</h2><p><br>According to a recent study, New Hampshire's lack of affordable housing is having a negative impact on its economy.

City leaders need to take action to address this issue, or Keene's economy will continue to decline.<p><h2> The effects of the high cost of living in Keene, New Hampshire</h2><p><br>The high cost of living in Keene, New Hampshire can have a number of negative effects on residents.
