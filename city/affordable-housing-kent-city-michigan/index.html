      <h2>Lack of affordable housing in Kent city</h2><p><br>There is a serious lack of affordable housing in the City of Kent. The median rental price for a two-bedroom apartment is $1,600, and the average sale price for a home is $370,000. According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, a family of four would need to earn a combined income of $77,000 to afford the rent on a two-bedroom apartment. However, the median household income in Kent is just $52,000.<br><br>This lack of affordable housing is having a devastating impact on low-income families and individuals. Many are forced to live in substandard housing or even on the street. The homeless population in Kent has increased by 30% over the past year.<br><br>There are a number of factors that have contributed to the lack of affordable housing in Kent. The city has experienced significant population growth in recent years, but the supply of housing has not kept pace. Additionally, the city has been slow to adopt policies that would encourage the development of more affordable housing. For example, the city does not have any inclusionary zoning ordinances that would require developers to set aside a certain percentage of units for low- and moderate-income households.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing is having a detrimental impact on the quality of life in Kent. It is time for the city to take action to address this critical issue.<p><h2>The high cost of housing in Kent city</h2><p><br>There's no doubt that housing costs in Kent city are high.

On the one hand, it attracts new businesses and residents to the city. On the other hand, it drives up the cost of living. The lack of available housing is also a major contributing factor to the high cost of housing. The high cost of construction is due to the city’s high-quality standards.<br><br>There are a number of ways to address the issue of the high cost of housing. The first is to build more housing.
