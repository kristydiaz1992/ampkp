      <h2>Why affordable housing is important in Tulare, California.</h2><p><br>Tulare, California is an agricultural town in the heart of the San Joaquin Valley. The town is known for its production of tomatoes, onions, and other vegetables. The median home price in Tulare is $134,000, which is much lower than the statewide median of $437,000.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing is a serious problem in California, as the state has some of the highest housing costs in the country.
