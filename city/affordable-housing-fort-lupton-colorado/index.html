The task force is exploring a number of options, including increasing the supply of affordable housing, providing financial assistance to families struggling to pay rent, and creating incentives for landlords to rent to families with vouchers.<br><br>The issue of affordable housing is complex, and there is no easy solution. However, the Fort Lupton community is committed to finding a way to provide housing for all of its residents.<p>
