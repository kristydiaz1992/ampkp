According to a report by the National Low Income Housing Coalition, only 24 percent of Cortland households can afford a two-bedroom apartment at the area median rent of $819. That leaves a significant number of residents who are forced to either pay a large portion of their income on housing or live in overcrowded or substandard conditions.<br><br>The high cost of housing is exacerbated by the fact that Cortland is a high-poverty area.

This is well above the statewide poverty rate of 14.0 percent and the national poverty rate of 12.7 percent.<br><br>There are a number of factors that contribute to the lack of affordable housing in Cortland.

This shortage leaves many households competing for a limited number of units, driving up rents and making it difficult to find an affordable place to live.<br><br>Another factor is the high cost of construction. The cost of land and labor in Cortland is significantly higher than the national average, making it more expensive to build new housing. This is one of the reasons why there has been very little new construction in Cortland in recent years.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing in Cortland is a significant problem that is having a negative impact on the lives of many residents. It is important for policymakers to be aware of the challenges facing Cortland and to work to find solutions that will increase the availability of affordable housing.<p><h2> How affordable housing is changing Cortland, Illinois</h2><p><br><br>Cortland, Illinois is a small town with a big heart.
