      <h2> The need for affordable housing in Cambridge, Illinois.</h2><p><br>As the city of Cambridge continues to grow, the need for affordable housing becomes more and more apparent. With the cost of living rising and wages staying relatively stagnant, many working families are struggling to make ends meet. The high cost of housing is one of the biggest factors in this equation, and it’s only getting worse as the years go by.<br><br>There are several reasons why the cost of housing is so high in Cambridge. One of the biggest factors is the lack of available land. As the city continues to grow, the amount of available land decreases, and the cost of the land that is available goes up. This is compounded by the fact that Cambridge is a highly desirable place to live, which drives up the demand for housing even further.<br><br>Another factor that contributes to the high cost of housing in Cambridge is the lack of affordable housing options. There are very few apartments or homes available for rent at prices that working families can afford. And, even if there are affordable units available, they are often in poor condition or located in unsafe neighborhoods.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing is not only a problem for working families, but it also impacts the city’s economy as a whole. When working families can’t afford to live in Cambridge, they are forced to move to other cities where the cost of living is lower. This leads to a brain drain, as the city loses out on the talent and skills of these families.<br><br>The high cost of housing is a complex problem with no easy solutions. However, the city of Cambridge is taking steps to address the issue. In 2017, the city approved a new Inclusionary Zoning Ordinance, which requires that a certain percentage of new developments be set aside for affordable housing. The city is also working with non-profit organizations to create more affordable housing options.<br><br>Despite these efforts, the problem of affordable housing in Cambridge remains a critical one. Working families are being priced out of the city, and the lack of affordable housing is having a negative impact on the city’s economy. It is clear that more needs to be done to address this issue.<p><h2> How affordable housing can help improve the Cambridge, Illinois community.</h2><p><br>The City of Cambridge, Illinois is addressing the need for affordable housing in our community. According to the 2010 census, the median household income in Cambridge is just over $31,000, and almost 25% of our residents live in poverty. This means that many of our residents are struggling to make ends meet, and access to safe and affordable housing is a critical issue.<br><br>One way that affordable housing can help improve the Cambridge community is by providing stability for families who are struggling to make ends meet. When families have stable housing, they are more likely to be able to maintain employment, keep their children enrolled in school, and access to vital services. Affordable housing can also help reduce crime and improve public safety. Studies have shown that areas with high concentrations of poverty are more likely to experience crime, and that stable housing can help reduce crime rates.<br><br>Affordable housing is an important part of creating a thriving and vibrant community, and the City of Cambridge is committed to working with our partners to create more opportunities for our residents.
