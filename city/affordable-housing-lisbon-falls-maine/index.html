      <h2>The unaffordable housing crisis in Lisbon Falls, Maine</h2><p><br>Lisbon Falls is in the midst of an affordable housing crisis. <br><br>Rents have been rising steadily for years, and now, they’re skyrocketing. Low-income residents are being forced out of their homes, and many are sleeping in their cars or on the streets. <br><br>The town’s only homeless shelter is full, and there’s a long waiting list for the few affordable apartments that are available. <br><br>This crisis is hitting everyone hard, but it’s especially difficult for seniors, low-income families, and people with disabilities. <br><br>The town is working on a plan to build more affordable housing, but it will take time. In the meantime, we need to do everything we can to help those who are being displaced. <br><br>If you know of any resources that could help, please share them.
