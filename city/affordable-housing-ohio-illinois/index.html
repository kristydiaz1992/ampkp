      <h2>The current state of affordable housing in Ohio and Illinois.</h2><p><br>There is a affordable housing crisis in Ohio and Illinois. The Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) which was created in 1986 has not been increased since its inception. The LIHTC allows developers to claim a tax credit for a portion of their development costs if they set aside a certain number of units for low- and moderate-income renters. <br><br>In order to qualify for the tax credit, a developer must set aside a minimum of 20% of their units for households that earn no more than 60% of the Area Median Income (AMI). However, the maximum tax credit that a developer can claim is $1.20 per square foot of the development. <br><br>The lack of an increase in the tax credit has led to a decrease in the number of units that are being developed and a decrease in the quality of the units that are being developed. In order to qualify for the tax credit, developers are often forced to make cuts in other areas of their development, such as cutting back on the number of amenities or using lower quality materials. <br><br>The affordable housing crisis is especially severe in Ohio and Illinois because the median income in these states is lower than the national median income. This means that a larger percentage of households in these states are considered low-income. <br><br>According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, there is a shortage of 7.2 million affordable and available rental homes for extremely low-income renters. In order to address the affordable housing crisis, we need to increase the Low Income Housing Tax Credit.<p><h2>How to find affordable housing in Ohio and Illinois.</h2><p><br>There are many ways to find affordable housing in Ohio and Illinois. One way is to search for government-sponsored housing programs in these states. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) offers a wide variety of affordable housing programs that are available in both Ohio and Illinois. Another way to find affordable housing is to search for listings on websites like Zillow and Trulia. These websites list homes for rent and sale in specific geographic areas. Finally, it is also possible to find affordable housing by contacting a real estate agent in Ohio or Illinois.<p><h2>The pros and cons of affordable housing in Ohio and Illinois.</h2><p><br>There are many pros and cons to affordable housing. Some people believe that affordable housing is a good thing because it allows people who may not be able to afford a traditional home to still have a place to live. Others believe that affordable housing can lead to higher crime rates and lower property values. <br><br>There are many affordable housing options in both Ohio and Illinois. In Ohio, the government has created a program called the Ohio Housing Trust Fund, which provides funding for affordable housing developments. Illinois has a similar program called the Illinois Housing Development Authority. <br><br>The pros of affordable housing include: <br><br>-Allows people of lower income to have a place to live<br>-Can help to reduce crime rates<br>-Can help to improve the economy<br><br>The cons of affordable housing include: <br><br>-Can lead to higher crime rates<br>-Can lower property values<br>-Can be a burden on taxpayers<p><h2>The history of affordable housing in Ohio and Illinois.</h2><p><br>The first affordable housing developments in Ohio were built in the 1970s in response to the increasing number of low-income families who were unable to find safe and decent housing. These developments were typically small, with just a few units, and were located in urban areas. Over time, the need for affordable housing grew, and developments became larger and more common. By the early 2000s, there were hundreds of affordable housing developments in Ohio, with thousands of units.<br><br>In Illinois, the first affordable housing developments were also built in the 1970s. However, the need for affordable housing was not as great as it was in Ohio, and the developments were smaller and less common. Over time, the need for affordable housing increased, and developments became larger and more common. By the early 2000s, there were dozens of affordable housing developments in Illinois, with hundreds of units.<p><h2>The future of affordable housing in Ohio and Illinois.</h2><p><br><br>There is no one-size-fits-all answer to the question of affordable housing. However, there are a number of factors that will impact the future of affordable housing in Ohio and Illinois.<br><br>One of the most important factors is the economy. The strength of the economy will have a direct impact on the availability of affordable housing. When the economy is strong, there is more demand for housing, which drives up prices. However, when the economy is weak, there is less demand for housing, which can lead to lower prices.<br><br>Another important factor is the population. As the population grows, there is more demand for housing. This can lead to higher prices, unless there is a corresponding increase in the supply of housing.<br><br>Government policies can also impact the future of affordable housing. For example, if the government implements policies that make it easier for people to buy homes, this could lead to more demand for housing and higher prices. However, if the government implements policies that make it harder for people to buy homes, this could lead to less demand for housing and lower prices.<br><br> ultimately, the future of affordable housing in Ohio and Illinois will be determined by a number of factors, including the economy, population, and government policies.<p>
