The town has a long history of being an affordable place to live, but recent years have seen a dramatic increase in the cost of living, particularly in the form of housing. This has created a situation where many residents are struggling to find affordable places to live, and some are even being forced to leave the town altogether.<br><br>The town has taken some steps to try to address the issue, including creating a task force to study the problem and developing a new affordable housing ordinance. However, it remains to be seen whether these steps will be enough to solve the problem.

Both options have their pros and cons, and the best decision for you will depend on your unique circumstances.<br><br>Renting has the advantage of being more flexible and often cheaper than buying, especially in the short-term. If you're not sure how long you'll stay in Thomaston or if your income may fluctuate, renting may be the more prudent choice. Additionally, renters typically don't have to worry about maintenance and repairs, as that is the landlord's responsibility.<br><br>However, renting also has its drawbacks.

Additionally, landlords can raise your rent at any time, and you may not have much say in the matter. If you're looking for stability and the ability to build equity, buying a home may be the better option.<br><br>Of course, buying a home is a much bigger financial commitment than renting, and it's not without its own risks. For one, if the housing market crashes, you could end up owing more on your mortgage than your home is worth. Additionally, repairs and maintenance become your responsibility when you own a home, and they can be expensive.<br><br>The best way to decide whether to rent or buy affordable housing in Thomaston, Maine is to carefully consider your own circumstances and what's important to you. If you value flexibility and low monthly costs, renting may be the better choice.

This program has been instrumental in the construction of new affordable housing developments in the town.<br><br>The tax credits have helped to make housing more affordable for many families and have led to a resurgence in the popularity of public housing. However, the credits are not always enough to cover the full cost of rent and this has led to a decline in the number of families that are able to participate in the program.<p>
