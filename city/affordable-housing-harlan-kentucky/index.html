This can have a profound impact on families, especially those who are struggling to make ends meet. When families have stable housing, they are more likely to be able to afford basic necessities like food and clothing, and they are less likely to experience homelessness or housing insecurity.<br><br>Affordable housing can also provide a much-needed sense of community for residents.

According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, a family earning the median income in Harlan County would need to work 82 hours per week to afford a two-bedroom apartment at the average fair market rent.
