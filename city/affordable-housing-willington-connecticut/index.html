      <h2> The Struggle to Find Affordable Housing in Willington, Connecticut</h2><p><br>The town of Willington, Connecticut is a quiet, rural community with a population of just over 10,000 people. The median household income is $85,000, and the median home value is $250,000. Despite its affluence, Willington is struggling to provide its residents with affordable housing.<br><br>The town has a limited amount of land available for development, and much of that land is already spoken for by businesses or farms. The town has been working to encourage more density in its existing neighborhoods, but that has been met with resistance from residents who value the townâ€™s small-town feel.<br><br>As a result, many residents are being priced out of the housing market. Renters are particularly vulnerable, as the town has very few apartment complexes. Those that do exist are often expensive and have long waiting lists.<br><br>The town is working on a number of solutions to this problem, including increasing the number of accessory dwelling units and encouraging more development of mixed-use properties. But until these solutions are implemented, the struggle to find affordable housing in Willington, Connecticut will continue.<p><h2> The Lack of Affordable Housing in Willington, Connecticut</h2><p><br>According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, a worker earning the minimum wage in Willington, Connecticut would need to work 119 hours per week to afford a two-bedroom apartment. <br><br>Willington is a town in Tolland County, Connecticut, United States. The population was 7,315 at the 2010 census. The median income for a household in the town was $78,750, and the median income for a family was $93,613.<br><br>The median rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Willington is $1,100, which is out of reach for many minimum wage earners. According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, a worker earning the minimum wage in Willington, Connecticut would need to work 119 hours per week to afford a two-bedroom apartment. <br><br>The high cost of housing is one of the biggest challenges facing low-income families in Willington. Many are forced to spend a large percentage of their income on rent, leaving little left over for other basic necessities like food, clothing, and transportation. <br><br>The lack of affordable housing is also a barrier to economic development in Willington. Businesses have a hard time attracting and retaining employees when housing is so expensive. This leads to a vicious cycle in which the town's economy suffers because of the high cost of housing, and the high cost of housing is a result of the town's weak economy. <br><br>The town of Willington is taking some steps to address the lack of affordable housing. In 2017, the town approved a plan to build 30 new units of affordable housing. The town is also working with a local nonprofit to rehab existing homes and make them available to low-income families. <br><br>These are positive steps, but they will do little to address the overall lack of affordable housing in Willington.

However, the waiting list for these units can be up to two years long.<br><br>There are also a few non-profit organizations that provide affordable housing in Willington, but again, the units are often limited and the waiting lists can be long.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing in Willington can have a serious impact on low-income families.
