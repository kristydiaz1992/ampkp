One of the key recommendations from the task force is to increase funding for affordable housing initiatives. This would help to create more affordable units and also provide assistance to low-income families who are struggling to pay their rent.<br><br>The politics of affordable housing can be complex. There are many different stakeholders involved, including landlords, developers, government officials, and low-income families. It can be difficult to find agreement on the best way to address the issue. However, it is clear that something needs to be done to address the affordable housing crisis in Marshall.<br><br>The city is currently working on a plan to increase funding for affordable housing initiatives.

That means that a staggering 60.5% of households are spending more than 30% of their income on housing costs.<br><br>There are a number of factors that have contributed to the current state of affairs in Marshall. For one, the town has experienced significant population growth in recent years, thanks in part to its proximity to the University of Michigan. This has put upward pressure on both home prices and rents.<br><br>Secondly, Marshall has been slow to add new housing units to keep up with this population growth. In the last five years, the town has issued an average of just 12 building permits per year. This lack of new construction has only exacerbated the affordable housing crisis.<br><br>So what can be done to address the affordable housing crisis in Marshall?<br><br>One potential solution is for the town to encourage more density through its zoning laws. By allowing for more multifamily dwellings and mixed-use developments, Marshall can provide more housing options for its residents.<br><br>Another solution is for the town to create a community land trust. This would allow Marshall to purchase and develop land that would be permanently affordable. This would be an especially beneficial tool for creating affordable housing near transit and other amenities.<br><br>Ultimately, it will take a concerted effort on the part of both the public and private sector to solve the affordable housing crisis in Marshall. But with the right policies in place, Marshall can ensure that its residents have a place to call home.<p>
