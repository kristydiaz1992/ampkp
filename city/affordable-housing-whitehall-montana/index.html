This leaves little room for other necessities like food, transportation, and healthcare. For many people in Whitehall, affordable housing is a matter of life and death.<br><br>There are a number of reasons why affordable housing is so important. First and foremost, it provides a roof over people’s heads. A safe andstable place to live is essential for physical and mental health.

This means that there are 3.1 million more extremely low-income renters than there are affordable homes.<br><br>The shortage of affordable housing is especially acute in rural areas. In Montana, for example, there are only 35 affordable and available rental homes for every 100 extremely low-income households. This leaves rural residents with few options other than to pay too much for rent, live in substandard housing, or move to a different community.<br><br>The problem of affordable housing is complex, but there are a number of things that can be done to address it. One obvious solution is to build more affordable housing. Another is to provide financial assistance to people who are struggling to pay their rent.<br><br>The town of Whitehall is already taking some steps in the right direction. The Whitehall Community Development Corporation is working to develop new affordable housing options. And the Whitehall City Council has committed to setting aside $50,000 in the upcoming budget to help residents with their rent.<br><br>These are important first steps, but more needs to be done.
