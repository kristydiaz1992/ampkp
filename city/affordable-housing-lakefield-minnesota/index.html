According to the latest figures from the National Housing Federation, house prices in the UK have risen by almost 30% over the past five years, while wages have only increased by an average of 10%. This means that many people are struggling to keep up with the rising cost of living, let alone save for a deposit on a new home.<br><br>The issue of housing affordability is particularly acute in Lakefield, where house prices have been rising faster than the national average. According to the latest figures from the Land Registry, the average price of a home in Lakefield has now reached £308,000, which is well out of reach for many local residents.<br><br>There are a number of factors that have contributed to the rising cost of housing in Lakefield. One of the most important is the lack of available land for new development. This has driven up the price of land, and made it difficult for developers to build new homes that are affordable for local residents.<br><br>Another factor that has contributed to the housing crisis is the rising cost of building materials. The price of bricks and mortar has risen significantly in recent years, as has the cost of other building materials such as insulation and windows. This has made it more expensive to build new homes, and has also made it difficult for developers to make a profit on their projects.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing in Lakefield is having a serious impact on the local community. Many people are being forced to move out of the area because they cannot afford to buy a home, and this is having a knock-on effect on local businesses and services. This is why it is so important for the government and local authorities to take action to address the housing crisis.<br><br>One of the most important things that needs to be done is to release more land for new development. This will help to bring down the price of land, and make it easier for developers to build new homes that are affordable for local residents. The government also needs to invest in infrastructure projects that will make it easier for developers to build new homes in Lakefield.<br><br>The housing crisis is a complex issue, and there is no easy solution. However, it is vital that the government and local authorities take action to address the problem. Only by working together can we hope to solve the housing crisis and make sure that everyone has a place to call home.<p><h2> What the future of affordable housing in Lakefield looks like</h2><p><br>It is estimated that the future of affordable housing in Lakefield will be positive. The demand for affordable housing is increasing, while the supply of affordable housing is decreasing.
