      <h2>The struggle to find affordable housing in Hartford, Kentucky.</h2><p><br>The median rent in Hartford, Kentucky is $837 for a one-bedroom apartment. For many residents, this is an unaffordable price. The city has a lack of affordable housing options, which forces residents to either pay a high price for rent or live in substandard housing.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing in Hartford results in many residents living in poverty. According to the Kentucky Housing Corporation, 26.8% of Hartford residents are considered to be “cost-burdened,” meaning they spend more than 30% of their income on housing. This leaves little money for other essentials, such as food, clothing, and transportation.<br><br>There are several reasons for the lack of affordable housing in Hartford. One reason is that the city is located in a rural area, which makes it difficult to build new housing developments. Another reason is that the city has a low median income, which makes it difficult for residents to afford high rent prices.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing in Hartford is a major problem that needs to be addressed. The city needs to find ways to increase the supply of affordable housing, so that residents can live in safe and decent housing.<p><h2>The high cost of housing and the burden it places on families in Hartford, Kentucky.</h2><p><br>There is no question that housing costs have been on the rise in recent years, and this has been especially true in the city of Hartford, Kentucky.

That is a increase of 41.2%.<br><br>This rise in housing costs has placed a burden on many families in Hartford. In 2000, the median household income in the city was $36,385. By 2016, it had only increased to $37,471. This means that families are not keeping up with the rising cost of housing, and are instead falling behind.<br><br>The high cost of housing is not only a problem for families in Hartford, but it is also a problem for the city as a whole. The high cost of housing is one of the main factors driving people out of the city. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the population of Hartford decreased from 21,099 in 2000 to 20,462 in 2016. This is a loss of 3.2%.<br><br>The high cost of housing is a problem that is not going away anytime soon. It is a problem that is affecting families and the city of Hartford as a whole.

The city is using a unique financing model to create new, affordable housing developments. This model is having a positive impact on the city's economy and its residents.<br><br>The city of Hartford is using a tax-increment financing (TIF) model to fund new affordable housing developments. Under this model, the city uses future tax revenue from the new developments to pay for the upfront costs of construction. This allows the city to provide new, affordable housing without putting any strain on its current budget.<br><br>This financing model is already having a positive impact on the city of Hartford. The city's first TIF-funded development, Hillcrest Heights, is expected to create over 100 new jobs and generate $3 million in annual tax revenue. This revenue will be used to fund other city services, such as education and public safety.<br><br>The Hillcrest Heights development is also having a positive impact on the residents of Hartford.

According to a report by the National Low Income Housing Coalition, only 18 percent of Hartford residents can afford a two-bedroom apartment at the fair market rent. This means that the majority of residents are forced to choose between paying for housing and other basic necessities like food and healthcare.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing can have a serious impact on residents' quality of life. For example, families may have to move into substandard housing or live in overcrowded conditions. This can lead to increased stress and anxiety, and can also impact children's education as they may have to switch schools frequently.<br><br>There are a number of factors that contribute to the lack of affordable housing in Hartford. One is the city's high poverty rate; nearly one-third of Hartford residents live in poverty. Another is the lack of available land for new development. This means that developers are not building new affordable housing units, and that the existing units are being taken off the market due to gentrification.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing is a serious problem in Hartford, and it is one that is impacting residents' quality of life. The city needs to find ways to increase the availability of affordable housing units, and to protect existing units from being taken off the market.<p>
