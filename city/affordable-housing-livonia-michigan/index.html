The population was 96,942 at the 2010 census, making it Michigan's ninth largest city. The city is a western suburb of Detroit and is part of the Metro Detroit area.<br><br>Livonia was first settled by pioneers from New England in 1834, who were attracted to the area by the promise of rich farmland. The first permanent settlers were French-Canadians from Montreal, who arrived in 1855. The city was incorporated in 1959.<br><br>Livonia is a predominantly white city, with a diverse range of ethnicities and races represented. The city has a large number of families with young children, and is known for its good schools and safe, quiet neighborhoods.<br><br>However, Livonia is also facing the challenge of providing affordable housing for its residents. The median home value in Livonia is $194,700, and the median rent is $1,225. The cost of living in Livonia is high, and many families are struggling to keep up with the rising costs of housing, childcare, and other essentials.<br><br>Livonia's high housing costs are due in part to the city's desirability as a place to live. The city is safe, has good schools, and is close to Detroit, making it an attractive option for many families. However, this also means that there is high demand for housing in Livonia, and not enough supply to meet that demand.<br><br>One solution to the affordable housing problem in Livonia is to build more affordable housing developments. However, this is not always possible or practical, and it can take years for new developments to be completed. In the meantime, families are struggling to pay rent and keep up with the cost of living.<br><br>The city of Livonia is working on a number of initiatives to try to address the affordable housing problem. The city has created a Task Force on Affordable Housing, which is working to identify solutions and make recommendations to the city council. The task force is exploring a number of options, including increasing the supply of affordable housing, providing financial assistance to families struggling to pay rent, and creating incentives for landlords to rent to families with low or moderate incomes.<br><br>The city is also working with Wayne County and other partners on a new program called the Wayne County Housing Choice Voucher Program.

The voucher program is still in the early stages, but it has the potential to provide much-needed assistance to families struggling to afford housing in Livonia.<br><br>The city of Livonia is committed to finding solutions to the affordable housing problem, and is exploring a number of different options.
