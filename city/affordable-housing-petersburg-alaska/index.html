The Task Force released its report in 2018 and the City has been working on implementing its recommendations.<br><br>One of the Task Force’s recommendations was to create an Affordable Housing Fund. The City has been working on this and it is expected to be operational in 2019. The Fund will provide money for the development of new affordable housing units in the City.<br><br>The City is also working on making it easier for people to build accessory dwelling units (ADUs). ADUs are small homes that are built on the same property as a single-family home. They can be used as a rental unit or for a family member to live in.<br><br>The City is hopeful that these and other initiatives will help to increase the supply of affordable housing in Petersburg. This is critical for the future of the City and its ability to attract and retain residents and businesses.<p>
