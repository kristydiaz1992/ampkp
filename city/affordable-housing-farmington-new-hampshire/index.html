The town has a long history of providing housing for low- and moderate-income residents, dating back to the early days of the town when it was first settled. However, the town has also seen its share of challenges in providing adequate housing for all its residents.<br><br>The first affordable housing developments in Farmington were built in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. These developments were typically small, single-family homes that were built on small lots. The town also built a number of multi-family dwellings, such as tenement buildings, during this time period.<br><br>The Great Depression and the ensuing years were tough ones for the town and its residents. Many people lost their jobs and were forced to move into substandard housing. The town's housing stock declined during this time, as did the quality of the housing that was available.<br><br>After World War II, the town began to see a resurgence. New businesses were established and new housing developments were built. However, these new developments were not always accessible to low- and moderate-income residents. In the late 20th century, the town began to focus on providing more affordable housing options for all its residents.<br><br>Today, Farmington has a variety of affordable housing options available. There are a number of apartments and duplexes that are available for rent at below-market rates. The town also has a number of homes that have been designated as affordable housing units. These units are available to qualified buyers who meet certain income requirements.<br><br>The history of affordable housing in Farmington, New Hampshire is a long and complicated one. However, the town has made great strides in recent years in providing housing options for all its residents.<p><h2> The future of affordable housing in Farmington, New Hampshire</h2><p><br>It's no secret that the cost of housing is a major issue in Farmington, New Hampshire. The median price of a home in the town is over $300,000, and the average rent for a two-bedroom apartment is $1,500.<br><br>There are a number of factors driving the high cost of housing in Farmington.

One is to build more affordable housing. There are a number of initiatives in the town to create more affordable housing, including a new ordinance that requires developers to set aside a certain percentage of units for affordable housing.<br><br>Another solution is to encourage more people to live in Farmington. This can be done by promoting the town as a great place to live and work, and by making it easier for people to move to Farmington.<br><br>The future of affordable housing in Farmington will depend on a number of factors, including the town's efforts to create more affordable housing and the overall state of the housing market.

The town is home to about 9,000 residents, and the median household income is just over $60,000.<br><br>One of the biggest challenges facing Farmington is the lack of affordable housing. The town's median home value is just over $200,000, and the median rent is just over $1,000. However, the town's median income is only about $60,000, so many residents can't afford to either buy or rent a home in Farmington.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing is having a number of negative impacts on Farmington. First, it's causing an exodus of young families from the town. Because they can't afford to buy or rent a home in Farmington, they're moving to other towns and cities where housing is more affordable. This is causing a brain drain in Farmington, as the town is losing its young, educated residents.<br><br>Second, the lack of affordable housing is also causing an increase in homelessness in Farmington. Because people can't afford to rent or buy a home, they're forced to live on the streets or in their cars. This is not only harmful to the homeless individuals themselves, but it also creates a negative image of the town.<br><br>Third, the lack of affordable housing is making it difficult for businesses to attract and retain employees. Many businesses are located in Farmington because it's a desirable location to live. However, if potential employees can't afford to live in Farmington, they're likely to choose another town or city where housing is more affordable. This could lead to businesses leaving Farmington, which would further hurt the town's economy.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing is a serious problem facing Farmington, and it's having a number of negative impacts on the town. If the town doesn't find a way to address the issue, it will only become more difficult for residents to live and work in Farmington.<p><h2> The need for affordable housing in Farmington, New Hampshire</h2><p><br><br>Farmington is a beautiful town in the heart of New Hampshire.
