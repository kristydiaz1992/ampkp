This leaves many people in the city struggling to find a safe and affordable place to live.<br><br>One of the main reasons why there is a lack of affordable housing in Festus is because the city has a high poverty rate.

But one way to help make affordable housing a reality is by reforming our zoning laws.<br><br>Zoning laws are the primary mechanism that local governments use to control land use. By dictating what can be built where, zoning laws have a profound impact on the affordability of housing. Unfortunately, our current zoning laws often work against affordability.<br><br>For example, minimum lot size requirements can artificially inflate the price of land, making it unaffordable for developers to build anything other than high-end, luxury housing. Similarly, density restrictions limit the number of homes that can be built on a given piece of land, further driving up prices.<br><br> reforming our zoning laws is a crucial step in making affordable housing a reality. By removing arbitrary barriers to development, we can help make housing more affordable for everyone.<p><h2>What is being done to address the affordable housing crisis in Festus, Missouri</h2><p><br>There is currently no affordable housing crisis in Festus, Missouri.<p><h2>The impact of the affordable housing crisis in Festus, Missouri</h2><p><br><br><br>InFestus, Missouri, the affordable housing crisis is having a devastating impact on residents.
