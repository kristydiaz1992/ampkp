It is part of the Sacramento Metropolitan Area. The population was 64,776 at the 2010 census. Rancho Cordova is the site of the California State Capital Museum, the American River Bike Trail, Folsom Lake, and many historical landmarks. <br><br>The history of affordable housing in Rancho Cordova is a long and complicated one. It is a history that is deeply intertwined with the history of segregation and racism in California. <br><br>The origins of affordable housing in Rancho Cordova can be traced back to the early 20th century when the city was still known as Mills Station. At that time, the city was a stop on the Sacramento Northern Railroad. The area around the railroad station was divided into two sections - one for white residents and one for black residents. <br><br>The white residents of Mills Station were mostly middle-class families who worked in the city's businesses or on the railroad. The black residents, on the other hand, were mostly poor and working class. They lived in cramped and dilapidated houses on the outskirts of town. <br><br>This segregation continued until the 1950s when the railroad station was demolished and the area around it was redeveloped. This redevelopment led to the construction of many new homes and apartments, which were mostly occupied by white residents. <br><br>Meanwhile, the black residents of Mills Station were relocated to the Meadowview area of Sacramento. This area was also segregated, with black residents living in substandard housing on the outskirts of town. <br><br>The situation began to change in the 1970s when the federal government implemented a new housing policy known as Section 8. This policy provided subsidies to landlords who rented to low-income tenants. As a result, many black families were able to move into better quality housing in Rancho Cordova and other parts of Sacramento. <br><br>Today, the issue of affordable housing in Rancho Cordova is still a significant one. The city has a large number of low-income residents and a shortage of affordable housing. In recent years, the city has been working to address this issue by building new affordable housing developments and providing financial assistance to low-income families.<p><h2>A profile of one of the residents of an affordable housing development in Rancho Cordova.</h2><p><br>Rancho Cordova is an affordable housing development in Rancho Cordova, California. The development is home to many low-income families and individuals, as well as some who are homeless. One of the residents of the development is a woman named Maria.<br><br>Maria is a single mother of two young children. She came to the United States from Mexico about ten years ago. She has worked hard to provide for her children, but money is always tight. Maria is grateful to have a safe place to live and is hopeful that her children will have a better life than she did.<p><h2>The challenges of finding affordable housing in Rancho Cordova.</h2><p><br>The Rancho Cordova area is considered to be a hot housing market, and as such, the prices for apartments and homes can be quite high. This can be a challenge for people who are looking for affordable housing in the area. There are a few things that can be done in order to try and find affordable housing in Rancho Cordova. <br><br>One option is to look for apartments that are in older buildings. These apartments may not have all of the same amenities as newer apartments, but they will be more affordable. Another option is to look for apartments that are in less desirable areas of town. These apartments may not be as close to shopping and other amenities, but they will be more affordable. <br><br>Another option is to look for rooms for rent in a house. This can be a good option for people who are looking for affordable housing and do not mind sharing a space with other people. There are many websites that list rooms for rent in Rancho Cordova and the surrounding area. <br><br>Finally, another option is to look for mobile homes for rent. Mobile homes can be a more affordable option than renting an apartment or a house. There are many mobile home parks in Rancho Cordova and the surrounding area. <br><br>Finding affordable housing in Rancho Cordova can be a challenge, but there are a few options that can be considered.<p><h2>How the rising cost of living is impacting residents of Rancho Cordova.</h2><p><br>Rancho Cordova is a city in Sacramento County, California, United States which incorporated in 2003. It is part of the Sacramento metropolitan area. The population was 64,776 at the 2010 census.

That's nearly $17,000 below the state median and leaves many residents struggling to make ends meet. The high cost of housing is the biggest factor, as the median home price in Rancho Cordova is $369,000, which is nearly $100,000 more than the state median. <br><br>The issue of the rising cost of living was brought to the forefront recently when the City Council approved a rent increase for mobile home park residents. The residents, many of whom are on fixed incomes, argued that the increase would make it difficult for them to continue living in the park. The Council ultimately approved the rent increase, but not without some hesitation. <br><br>The rising cost of living is a complex issue and there is no easy solution. However, the City Council and city staff are committed to working with residents to find ways to make life more affordable in Rancho Cordova.<p><h2>The different types of affordable housing available in Rancho Cordova.</h2><p><br>There are many types of affordable housing in Rancho Cordova, from apartments to single-family homes.
