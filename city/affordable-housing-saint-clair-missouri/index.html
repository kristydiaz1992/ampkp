In the past, Saint Clair was a largely white, middle-class suburb. But today, the suburb is becoming increasingly diverse, with a growing number of black and Latino residents. And as the suburb becomes more diverse, so too is the demand for affordable housing.<br><br>There are a number of factors driving this change. First, many families are being priced out of urban areas like Chicago and are moving to the suburbs in search of more affordable options. Second, the city of Saint Clair is actively working to increase the availability of affordable housing. In 2017, the city approved a $15 million plan to redevelop a vacant lot into an affordable housing complex.<br><br>The changing demographics of Saint Clair are having a big impact on the local economy.

However, there are a number of factors that will likely play a role in shaping this future.<br><br>One of the most important factors is the increasing cost of living. Saint Clair County is already one of the most expensive places to live in the state of Michigan, and this trend is only expected to continue. As housing costs continue to rise, it will become increasingly difficult for low- and moderate-income families to find affordable housing options.<br><br>Another factor that will likely play a role in the future of affordable housing is the county's population growth. Saint Clair County is projected to experience significant population growth over the next several years, which will put even more pressure on the housing market. This population growth will also create new demand for affordable housing, as more families will need assistance in finding a place to live.<br><br>The county's economic development will also play a role in shaping the future of affordable housing. As the county's economy continues to grow, there will be more opportunities for families to find good-paying jobs. However, this growth will also lead to increased competition for housing, which could make it even more difficult for families to find affordable options.<br><br>Ultimately, the future of affordable housing in Saint Clair County will be determined by a variety of factors. However, the most important factor will be the county's ability to provide housing that is both affordable and accessible to all residents.<p>
