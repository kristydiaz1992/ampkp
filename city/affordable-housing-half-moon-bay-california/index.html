This is pricing out many residents, especially those who work in the city but do not make a high income.<br><br>There are a number of reasons for the lack of affordable housing in Half Moon Bay.

The city is also a popular tourist destination, which drives up the cost of housing.<br><br>The city has been working to address the issue of affordable housing, but it has been difficult to find solutions that work. The city has created a number of affordable housing developments, but they have been slow to be built due to a lack of funding. The city has also been exploring the possibility of building taller buildings in order to create more housing, but this has been met with resistance from the community.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing is a complex problem that will require a variety of solutions. The city is working on a number of fronts to try to address the issue, but it will take time to find the right solution. In the meantime, residents who are struggling to find housing may have to look outside of Half Moon Bay for options.<p>
