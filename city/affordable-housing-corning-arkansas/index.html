The town is located in the northeastern corner of the state, about an hour's drive from Memphis, Tennessee.<br><br>Corning is a typical small town in many ways. The town has a single stoplight, a few small businesses, and not much else. However, Corning is also unique in one important way: the town has a strong commitment to affordable housing.<br><br>Corning's affordable housing program began in the late 1990s, when the town's leaders realized that many of the town's residents were struggling to keep up with the rising cost of housing.
