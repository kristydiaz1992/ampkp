It’s a place to sleep, to keep your belongings, and to feel safe. For many people in Clarkston, however, safe and affordable housing is a struggle.<br><br>There is a severe shortage of income-based housing in Clarkston, and the few options that are available are often overcrowded, in disrepair, and far from public transportation or other amenities. This leaves many residents, particularly those who are low-income or have disabilities, feeling trapped and desperate.<br><br>Even those who are employed often can’t afford housing in Clarkston. The median rent for a two-bedroom apartment in the city is $1,250, while the median income is just $26,000. This leaves many residents struggling to pay their rent, put food on the table, and keep up with other basic expenses.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing isn’t just a problem in Clarkston, of course. It’s a national crisis that is only getting worse. But in Clarkston, the problem is especially acute. The city has the highest percentage of refugees in the United States, and many of them are struggling to find housing that they can afford.<br><br>The situation is dire, but there are some organizations and individuals working to make a difference.

This left the area with a large number of vacant and abandoned properties.<br><br>In the late 1960s, the City of Atlanta began to redevelop the area now known as Clarkston. The first step in this redevelopment was the construction of the Georgia World Congress Center, which was completed in 1976. This project was followed by the construction of the Atlanta Fulton County Stadium, which was completed in 1977.<br><br>The redevelopment of these two areas created a need for affordable housing. In response to this need, the City of Atlanta created the Section 8 program. This program provides assistance to low-income households by subsidizing their rent.<br><br>The Section 8 program has been successful in Clarkston, and has helped to revitalize the area. In recent years, the City of Atlanta has been working to create even more affordable housing options in Clarkston. One of the most recent developments is the Subsidized Housing Project.<br><br>The Subsidized Housing Project is a mixed-income housing development that will provide affordable housing to low-income households. The project is still in the early stages of development, but it is expected to be completed by the end of 2020.<br><br>The Subsidized Housing Project is just one example of the many affordable housing developments that have been built in Clarkston in recent years.

Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC)<br><br>The LIHTC program is a federal program that provides tax breaks to developers who build or rehabilitate housing for low- and moderate-income households.

Project-Based Section 8<br><br>The Project-Based Section 8 program is a federal program that provides rental assistance to low-income households. Unlike the Housing Choice Voucher program, which allows voucher holders to choose their own housing, the Project-Based Section 8 program requires voucher holders to live in specific developments that have been designated as Project-Based Section 8 developments.<br><br>Pros: <br><br>-Project-Based Section 8 developments are often newly constructed or newly renovated, which means that they are often of high quality. <br>-Developments designated as Project-Based Section 8 developments must set aside a certain percentage of units for low-income households, which increases the availability of affordable housing. <br><br>Cons: <br><br>-Voucher holders are required to live in specific developments, which limits their housing options. <br>-Units in Project-Based Section 8 developments may be subject to income restrictions, which can limit the pool of potential tenants.<p><h2> How Can We Improve Affordable Housing in Clarkston?</h2><p><br>Clarkston is a city in Georgia that is known for its diversity and affordability.

This is an important issue and one that the city is committed to solving.<p>
