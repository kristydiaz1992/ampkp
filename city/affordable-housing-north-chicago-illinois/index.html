This can be done by providing incentives to developers who build affordable housing, such as tax breaks or fast-tracked approvals. The city can also make it easier for developers to build on vacant or underutilized land.<br><br>Another way to create more affordable housing is to provide more support for existing affordable housing units. This can be done by increasing funding for affordable housing initiatives, such as the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program. The city can also help to preserve existing affordable housing units by working with landlords to prevent them from converting units to market-rate rent.<br><br>The issue of affordable housing is complex and there is no easy solution. However, by taking a comprehensive approach and working to create more affordable housing units, the city of Chicago can make progress in addressing this important issue.<p>
