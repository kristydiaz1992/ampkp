The median rent for a two-bedroom apartment is $1,600, and the median income for a family of four is $60,000. That means that a family would have to spend more than half of their income on housing just to keep a roof over their heads.<br><br>The city council is considering a measure that would require developers to set aside a certain percentage of units in new developments for affordable housing. This would help to ensure that families of all income levels would have access to safe, quality housing.<br><br>However, some members of the council are hesitant to support the measure, as they believe it would discourage development and hurt the city's economy. Others argue that the city can't afford to wait any longer to address the housing crisis, and that this measure is a necessary step.<br><br>If you support the measure to require developers to set aside units for affordable housing, here are a few arguments you can make to the city council:<br><br>1. The housing crisis is only going to get worse if we don't do something to address it.<br><br>2. Families shouldn't have to spend more than half of their income just to keep a roof over their heads.<br><br>3. This measure would help to ensure that all residents of Brockton have access to quality, affordable housing.<br><br>4. The city's economy will suffer if we don't address the housing crisis, as businesses will be hesitant to locate here if their employees can't find affordable places to live.<br><br>5. Other cities have successfully implemented similar measures, and there's no reason why Brockton can't do the same.<br><br>If you believe that the city council should take action to require developers to set aside units for affordable housing, be sure to make your voice heard.
