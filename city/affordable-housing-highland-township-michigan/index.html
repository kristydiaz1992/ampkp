      <h2> 5 Ways to Improve Affordable Housing in Highland Township</h2><p><br>There is no one-size-fits-all solution to the affordable housing crisis, but here are five ways that Highland Township can improve affordable housing options for residents:<br><br>1. Incentivize developers to build more affordable housing.<br><br>One way to incentivize developers to build more affordable housing is to offer density bonuses, which allow them to build more units on a given parcel of land than would normally be allowed. This can help make development projects more financially feasible for builders, and ultimately lead to more affordable housing options for residents.<br><br>2. Create a community land trust.<br><br>Community land trusts are organizations that purchase land and then lease it to homeowners or developers with the intention of keeping the property affordable in perpetuity. This can help ensure that there is a stock of affordable housing in the community that is not at risk of being gentrified or redeveloped.<br><br>3. Require inclusionary zoning.<br><br>Inclusionary zoning is a planning tool that requires a certain percentage of units in new developments to be set aside for low- or moderate-income households. This can help create a mix of incomes and help to prevent neighborhoods from becoming too homogeneous.<br><br>4. Make use of public land.<br><br>Highland Township can make use of public land to create new affordable housing developments. This land can either be leased or sold to developers at a discounted rate, with the stipulation that the units built on the site must be affordable.<br><br>5. Increase funding for affordable housing initiatives.<br><br>The township can increase funding for affordable housing initiatives by allocating more money to the Highland Township Housing Commission or by establishing a dedicated affordable housing fund. This additional funding can be used to create or preserve affordable housing units, provide down payment assistance, or fund other initiatives that make housing more affordable for residents.<p><h2> 3 Key Issues Facing Affordable Housing in Highland Township</h2><p><br>There is a severe shortage of affordable housing in rural areas like Highland Township. This leaves many residents struggling to find safe and affordable places to live. Here are three key issues facing affordable housing in Highland Township:<br><br>1. A Lack of Low-Income Housing<br>There is a severe lack of low-income housing in Highland Township. This leaves many residents struggling to find safe and affordable places to live. According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, there are only 31 affordable and available rental homes for every 100 extremely low-income households in the area. This leaves many residents forced to live in substandard housing, or even on the streets.<br><br>2. High Housing Costs<br>Housing costs in Highland Township are relatively high, making it difficult for low-income residents to find affordable places to live. The median rent for a two-bedroom apartment in the area is $935, which is unaffordable for many residents. Additionally, the median home price in Highland Township is $183,000, which is out of reach for many low-income residents.<br><br>3. A Lack of Housing Options<br>There is a lack of housing options in Highland Township, which leaves many residents struggling to find safe and affordable places to live. According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, there are only 31 affordable and available rental homes for every 100 extremely low-income households in the area. This leaves many residents forced to live in substandard housing, or even on the streets.<p><h2> How a Lack of Affordable Housing is Impacting Highland Township</h2><p><br>There is no denying that the cost of housing is rising rapidly across the United States. In fact, according to The National Low Income Housing Coalition, the average American worker would need to earn $26.00/hour to afford a modest two-bedroom apartment. <br><br>This is becoming increasingly difficult for many people, especially those who live in rural areas like Highland Township. According to the Michigan State Housing Development Authority, the average rent for a one-bedroom apartment in Highland Township is $693/month. This means that a family of four would need to earn at least $27,720/year to afford a two-bedroom apartment – which is well above the median income for the area. <br><br>The lack of affordable housing is having a profound impact on Highland Township. Families are being forced to move further away from their jobs, which leads to longer commutes and less time with loved ones. Children are being forced to change schools, which can be disruptive to their education. And, perhaps most importantly, people are struggling to simply keep a roof over their heads. <br><br>There is no easy solution to the affordable housing crisis, but it is clear that something needs to be done. Local, state, and federal officials need to work together to create more affordable housing options for families in Highland Township and across the country.<p><h2> The Importance of Affordable Housing in Highland Township</h2><p><br>Highland Township is a beautiful, historic community located in the heart of the Leelanau Peninsula. The township is home to many small businesses and a large number of retirees. The housing market in Highland Township is very tight, with a limited number of affordable homes available for sale or rent. This has led to an increase in homelessness and a decrease in the quality of life for many residents.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing in Highland Township is a major problem that needs to be addressed. Homelessness is a serious issue that can have a devastating impact on individuals and families. A lack of affordable housing can also lead to an increase in crime and a decrease in the quality of life for residents.<br><br>The township has been working to address the issue of affordable housing by partnering with local organizations and businesses. The township has also been working to increase the number of affordable housing units available for residents.<br><br>The issue of affordable housing is an important one for the community of Highland Township. The township needs to continue to work to address the issue and to make sure that residents have access to affordable housing.<p><h2> What Highland Township is Doing to Address Affordable Housing</h2><p><br><br>Highland Township is committed to addressing the issue of affordable housing. The Township has created a Housing Commission and a Housing Task Force to study the issue and make recommendations to the Board of Trustees. The Housing Commission is made up of seven members who are appointed by the Board of Trustees. The Housing Task Force is made up of representatives from the business community, social service agencies, faith-based organizations, and the Highland Township Board of Trustees.<br><br>The Housing Commission has been meeting since May of 2018 and has been working on a housing needs assessment. The assessment will be used to identify gaps in the current housing stock and to make recommendations on how to address the needs of low- and moderate-income residents. The housing needs assessment is expected to be completed in the fall of 2018.<br><br>The Housing Task Force has been meeting since July of 2018 and is working on a housing plan. The plan will identify strategies to create and preserve affordable housing in Highland Township. The Task Force is expected to complete the housing plan in the winter of 2018.<p>
