The Berlin community is a rural community located in the White Mountains region of New Hampshire. The community is home to many low-income families who struggle to make ends meet. The availability of affordable housing has helped many of these families to find a place to live that is safe and secure.

The Berlin Housing Authority reports that the waiting list for Section 8 housing assistance is currently at over 1,000 families. This is despite the fact that the city has made a concerted effort to increase the availability of affordable housing, including the development of a new community housing complex and the rehabilitation of existing housing units.<br><br>The high cost of housing is one of the biggest challenges facing Berlin residents. The median rent for a two-bedroom apartment in the city is $1,058, which is well above the national average of $949. For many Berlin residents, wages have not kept pace with rising housing costs. The median household income in the city is $42,013, which is below the statewide average of $63,470.<br><br>There are a number of factors that have contributed to the high cost of housing in Berlin.

This has made it difficult for landlords to keep rents affordable, as they must make needed repairs and upgrades while also meeting their own financial obligations.<br><br>The city is working to address the challenges of affordable housing. In addition to the new community housing complex and the rehabilitation of existing units, the city has also enacted a number of zoning reforms that are designed to make it easier for developers to build new affordable housing.
