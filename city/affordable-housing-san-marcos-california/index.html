      <h2>The high cost of housing in San Marcos</h2><p><br>There's no denying that the cost of housing in San Marcos is high. According to a report from the National Low Income Housing Coalition, the average rent for a two-bedroom apartment in San Marcos is $1,832, which is more than double the national average of $842.<br><br>The high cost of housing is a major burden for low-income families and individuals, who often have to spend a significant portion of their income on housing costs. This can make it difficult to afford other necessities, such as food and transportation.<br><br>The high cost of housing is also a problem for the city's economy. Businesses have a hard time attracting and retaining employees when housing is so expensive. This can lead to a brain drain, as talented workers move to other cities where housing is more affordable.<br><br>There are a number of factors that contribute to the high cost of housing in San Marcos. The city's close proximity to San Diego and Los Angeles makes it a desirable place to live, which drives up prices. The city's lack of zoning laws also contributes to the problem, as developers can build whatever they want, without regard for the impact on the city's housing stock.<br><br>The city is working on a number of solutions to the high cost of housing, including increasing the supply of affordable housing, providing financial assistance to low-income families, and reforming the city's zoning laws.

In 2016, they approved a plan to build 1,000 new affordable housing units by 2020. However, only a fraction of those units have been built so far.<br><br>The city needs to do more to address the affordable housing crisis. They should increase funding for affordable housing projects and streamline the approval process.
