The city has been struggling with affordable housing issues for decades, and the problem has only gotten worse in recent years.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing in Big Rapids is not new. In fact, the issue dates back to the early days of the city. In the late 1800s, Big Rapids was home to a large number of factories and mills. The workers who operated these businesses were paid low wages, and many of them lived in company-owned housing that was substandard.<br><br>The situation improved somewhat in the early 20th century, as the city began to attract more middle-class families. However, the Great Depression hit Big Rapids hard, and many of these families lost their homes. The city's affordable housing problem worsened again in the 1960s, as factories began to close and jobs were lost.<br><br>Since then, the city has been struggling to find a solution to its affordable housing crisis. A number of initiatives have been tried, but nothing has really worked. The problem has only gotten worse in recent years, as the cost of living in Big Rapids has gone up and the supply of affordable housing has dwindled.<br><br>The city is currently working on a new plan to address the affordable housing crisis. This plan includes a number of different strategies, such as providing incentives for developers to build more affordable housing, increasing the availability of public housing, and working with landlords to keep rents affordable.<br><br>Only time will tell if this new plan will be successful. However, the city is committed to finding a solution to the affordable housing problem, and it is hopeful that this new plan will finally make a difference.<p>
