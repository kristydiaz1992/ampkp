      <h2> The current state of affordable housing in Gilbert, Arizona</h2><p><br> Gilbert, Arizona is a rapidly growing city in the Phoenix metropolitan area. The population has exploded in recent years, and the city has struggled to keep up with the demand for housing. The result is that the cost of living in Gilbert has gone up and affordable housing has become increasingly difficult to find.<br><br>There are a number of factors that have contributed to this situation. The first is that the city has not been able to keep up with the population growth. The second is that many of the city's workers are in low-paying jobs, which makes it difficult to afford rent or a mortgage. And finally, the city has not been able to attract enough investment in affordable housing.<br><br>The result is that many Gilbert residents are being forced to move to other parts of the state or even out of state in order to find affordable housing. This is a problem that the city needs to address if it wants to keep its residents.<br><br>One way that the city could address this issue is by increasing investment in affordable housing. This could be done through a variety of means, such as offering tax breaks to developers or increasing funding for affordable housing initiatives.<br><br>Another way to address the issue is by increasing the minimum wage. This would help low-income workers be able to afford rent or a mortgage. And finally, the city could also consider zoning changes that would allow for more density, which would make it easier to build new housing.<br><br>The city of Gilbert needs to take action to address the affordable housing crisis. Otherwise, it risks losing its residents to other parts of the state or even out of state.<p><h2> How to find affordable housing in Gilbert, Arizona</h2><p><br>There are many ways to find affordable housing in Gilbert, Arizona.
