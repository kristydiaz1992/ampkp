It is a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is always a light that can guide us to safety.<p><h2>The history of Affordable Housing in Butte</h2><p> County<br><br><br><br>Butte County has a long and rich history of affordable housing. It all started in the late 1800s, when gold was discovered in the area. This led to a boom in the local economy, and an influx of people looking for work. The problem was that there was a limited amount of housing available, and what was available was very expensive.<br><br>This led to the development of affordable housing options for workers, such as boarding houses and tent cities. These options were not ideal, but they were affordable and allowed people to stay close to the mines where they worked.<br><br>As the economy continued to grow, more and more people moved to Butte County. This led to an increase in the demand for housing, and the prices of housing continued to rise. In response to this, the Butte County Housing Authority was created in the early 1940s.<br><br>The Housing Authority’s first project was the Oakdale Heights housing development, which was built in 1942. This development was intended for low-income families, and it was the first of its kind in the area.<br><br>Since then, the Housing Authority has continued to develop affordable housing options for residents of Butte County. They have built and managed many different developments, and they currently manage over 1,600 units of affordable housing.<br><br>The Housing Authority’s work has been crucial in ensuring that Butte County is a place where people of all incomes can find a place to call home.<p><h2>Silver Bow</h2><p> Montana<br><br>Welcome to Silver Bow, Montana!
