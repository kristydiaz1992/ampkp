With this growth comes the need for more housing, and Tempe has been working to increase its stock of affordable housing. In recent years, the city has adopted an inclusionary zoning ordinance, which requires developers to set aside a certain number of units for low- and moderate-income households. Tempe has also established a fund to provide down payment assistance for first-time homebuyers.<br><br>The city’s efforts to increase affordable housing are commendable, but there are both pros and cons to this approach. On the one hand, affordable housing can help to address the needs of low- and moderate-income households, who often have difficulty finding housing that is both affordable and of a good quality. Additionally, affordable housing can help to create more economically diverse communities, which can lead to increased social cohesion and better opportunities for upward mobility.<br><br>On the other hand, affordable housing can also have some drawbacks. For example, if not managed properly, affordable housing developments can lead to increased crime and social problems. Additionally, affordable housing can put strain on city resources, as the city is often responsible for providing services to these developments.<br><br>Overall, the city of Tempe is taking a proactive approach to increasing its stock of affordable housing. While there are some potential drawbacks to this approach, the city is working to mitigate these risks and create more opportunities for all of its residents.<p>
