Arvin is located 15 miles (24 km) southeast of Bakersfield and is part of the Bakersfield-Delano Metropolitan Statistical Area.<br><br>Arvin is notable for being the birthplace of country music singer Merle Haggard.<p><h2> How Arvin is Working to Address the Affordable Housing Crisis</h2><p><br><br>The affordable housing crisis is a growing problem in the United States. According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, there is a shortage of 7.2 million affordable and available rental homes for extremely low income households, and the problem is only getting worse.<br><br>Arvin is committed to helping address this crisis. We are working with partners across the country to develop and finance affordable housing developments that will provide quality homes for those who need them most.<br><br>In addition, we are also working to advocate for policy changes at the local, state, and federal level that will help create more affordable housing opportunities. We believe that everyone deserves a safe and affordable place to call home, and we will continue to fight for policies that will make that a reality.<p>
