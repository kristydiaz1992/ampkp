      <h2> The Affordable Housing Crisis in Hartford City</h2><p><br>There is an affordable housing crisis in Hartford City. In 2015, only 29% of households in the city were considered affordable, meaning that they spent less than 30% of their income on housing costs. This number has likely only gone down since then, as rents in the city have continued to increase.<br><br>This crisis has a number of causes. One is the city's high poverty rate; over 30% of residents live in poverty, which makes it difficult to afford rent. Another cause is the lack of affordable housing units in the city.
