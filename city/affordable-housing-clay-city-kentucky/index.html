This is well above the national average rent of $742 per month.<br><br>There are a number of factors that contribute to the high cost of housing in Clay City. One is the fact that the city is located in a rural area. This means that there is less housing stock available, and that the houses that are available are often more expensive than in urban areas.

Unfortunately, this means that there is a lot of competition for the limited number of affordable housing options that are available. This is why it is so important for the city to find ways to increase the supply of affordable housing.<br><br>One way to do this is to encourage more development of multi-family housing, such as apartments and condos. This would provide more options for people who are looking for affordable housing, and it would also help to address the issue of the city being spread out. Another way to increase the supply of affordable housing is to offer incentives to developers who build houses that are intended for low- and moderate-income families.<br><br>The city also needs to do a better job of enforcing its zoning laws. There are a number of properties in Clay City that are zoned for commercial use but are being used for residential purposes. This is contributing to the lack of available housing, as these properties could be used to build more homes. If the city enforced its zoning laws more strictly, it would free up more land for housing development.<br><br>Ultimately, the solution to the affordable housing crisis in Clay City lies in increasing the supply of housing.
