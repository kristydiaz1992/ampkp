This lack of land can drive up the cost of housing, as developers are forced to build on smaller lots or outside of the town limits.<br><br>Another challenge facing Ollie is the lack of available financing for new housing developments. banks are often reluctant to lend money for projects in rural areas, and this can make it difficult for developers to get the funding they need to build new homes.<br><br>Despite these challenges, there is reason to be optimistic about the future of affordable housing in Ollie, Iowa. The town has a number of assets that could be leveraged to attract new businesses and families. For example, Ollie is home to a highly-skilled workforce, and the town has a strong reputation for being a good place to live and raise a family.

By attract new businesses and families to the area, the town can increase the supply of affordable housing and help to improve the lives of its residents.<p>
