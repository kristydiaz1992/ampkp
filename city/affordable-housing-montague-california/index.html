      <h2>Affordable Housing in Montague: A Lifeline for Low</h2><p>-Income Families<br><br>There is no denying that housing costs are a major burden for low-income families. In Montague, Massachusetts, the median rent for a two-bedroom apartment is $1,100 â€“ well out of reach for many residents. Even those who do manage to find affordable housing often have to sacrifice quality and location.<br><br>But there is some good news.

These developments are often a lifeline for families who would otherwise be struggling to make ends meet.<br><br>One such development is the Woodridge Apartments, which opened in 2016. The Woodridge offers 56 units of affordable housing for families, seniors, and people with disabilities. Located just a short drive from downtown Montague, the Woodridge is a much-needed option for those who need affordable housing.<br><br>Another recent development is the Montague Mill Apartments, which opened in 2017. The Mill offers 66 units of affordable housing for families, seniors, and people with disabilities.

With more affordable housing options available, families are able to find safe, quality homes that they can afford. This, in turn, helps to stabilize families and improve the overall health of the community.<p><h2>Income Families</h2><p><br>There are many families in the United States that are considered to be "income families." This means that they have a total family income that falls below a certain level. For example, a family of four that has a total income of $25,000 or less would be considered to be an income family.<br><br>There are many challenges that income families face. One of the biggest challenges is making ends meet. This can be a struggle because they often don't have enough money to cover all of their expenses. This can lead to things like late bills, skipping meals, and not being able to afford basic necessities.<br><br>Another challenge that income families face is finding affordable housing. This can be difficult because they often can't afford to live in safe and decent housing. This can lead to them living in unsafe and unhealthy conditions.<br><br>Finally, another challenge that income families face is getting access to quality healthcare. This can be difficult because they often can't afford to pay for health insurance. This can lead to them not being able to get the care they need.<br><br>Despite the challenges that income families face, there are also many organizations and programs that can help them. There are many charities that provide financial assistance to income families. There are also many government programs that can help income families with things like housing and healthcare.<br><br>If you are an income family, know that you are not alone.
