However, there are a number of benefits to living in affordable housing in Westbrook. One of the biggest benefits is that you will have more money to spend on other things. When you are not spending a large chunk of your income on housing, you will have more money to spend on things like food, clothes, and entertainment.<br><br>Another benefit of living in affordable housing is that you will be able to live closer to the city center.

First, some residents may feel that their neighborhood is becoming too low-income and that their property values will decline as a result. Additionally, affordable housing developments can sometimes be poorly-maintained and can attract crime. Finally, affordable housing can lead to increased traffic and congestion in a neighborhood.<p>
