      <h2> The current state of affordable housing in Baldwyn, Mississippi.</h2><p><br>The city of Baldwyn, Mississippi has long been struggling with affordable housing.

With a limited amount of land available for new development, it can be difficult to find sites that are suitable for affordable housing.<br><br>Another challenge is the cost of construction. The price of land and construction materials has been rising in recent years, making it more difficult to build new affordable housing developments that are within reach of low- and moderate-income families.<br><br>We are also up against competition from other cities and counties who are also seeking to attract development projects.
