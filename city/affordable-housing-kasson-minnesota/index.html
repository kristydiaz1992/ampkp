The city is located in Dodge County, in the southeastern part of the state. Kasson is about 30 miles from Minneapolis, the state's largest city. Despite its small size, Kasson faces the same challenges as many other cities when it comes to affordable housing.<br><br>One of the biggest challenges is that there is a limited amount of land available for new development. This means that developers must compete for land, which drives up the cost of land and ultimately the cost of new housing.

This means that many people are only in Kasson for a few hours each day, which doesn't leave a lot of time or opportunity to develop new housing.<br><br>The city has been working on a number of initiatives to address the affordable housing challenge. One is to create a community land trust, which would allow the city to purchase land and then lease it to developers at a reduced rate. The city is also working with a private developer to build a new mixed-use development that will include both retail and housing. This development will be built on city-owned land, which will keep the cost of the land down.<br><br>The city is also looking at ways to incentivize developers to build more affordable housing. One idea is to create a special assessment district that would tax new developments to help pay for affordable housing. The city is also considering a program that would provide loans to developers to build affordable housing.<br><br>Kasson is a small city with a big heart. The city is taking a number of steps to address the challenge of affordable housing, and it is hopeful that these initiatives will make a difference.<p><h2> Why affordable housing is important for Kasson, Minnesota</h2><p><br>There are many reasons why affordable housing is important for Kasson, Minnesota.
