This leaves many residents struggling to pay rent, and often forced to live in substandard housing.<br><br>The crisis has also put a strain on the city's resources. The Carlisle Housing Authority has had to turn away hundreds of families who need help with their rent, because there simply isn't enough funding to go around. This has put a strain on social service agencies, as well as on the city's finances.<br><br>The shortage of affordable housing has also made it difficult for businesses to attract and retain employees.
