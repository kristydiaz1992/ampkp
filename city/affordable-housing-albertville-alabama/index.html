      <h2>10 ways to make affordable housing work in your community</h2><p><br>The high cost of housing is a major problem across the United States. A recent study by the National Low Income Housing Coalition found that there is a severe shortage of affordable rental homes for extremely low income renters, defined as those earning 30% or less of the area median income. The study found that for every 100 extremely low income renters, there are only 35 affordable and available rental units. This leaves a gap of 65 units for every 100 extremely low income renters.<br><br>There are a number of ways that communities can make affordable housing work. Here are 10:<br><br>1. Increase funding for affordable housing initiatives<br>One way to make affordable housing work in your community is to increase funding for affordable housing initiatives. This could include increasing funding for affordable housing construction, rehabilitation, and preservation. It could also include increasing funding for housing vouchers and other assistance programs.<br><br>2. Zoning for affordable housing<br>Another way to make affordable housing work in your community is to make sure that there is adequate zoning for affordable housing. This means that there should be zoning regulations that allow for the development of affordable housing, such as density bonuses and inclusionary zoning.<br><br>3. Incentives for developers<br>Incentives can be a powerful tool for getting developers to build affordable housing. Communities can offer a variety of incentives, such as tax breaks, fast-track permitting, and infrastructure subsidies.<br><br>4. Require affordable housing in new developments<br>One way to ensure that new developments include affordable housing is to require that a certain percentage of units be set aside for low- and moderate-income households. This can be done through inclusionary zoning ordinances or other regulations.<br><br>5. Develop land banks<br>Land banks are public entities that acquire, manage, and develop vacant and abandoned properties. They can be used to develop affordable housing, as well as to stabilize neighborhoods and prevent blight.<br><br>6. Create community land trusts<br>Community land trusts are another tool that can be used to develop and preserve affordable housing. They are nonprofit organizations that own and manage land for the benefit of the community. CLTs often develop and operate affordable housing, as well as community gardens, parks, and other amenities.<br><br>7. Create housing cooperatives<br>Housing cooperatives are a type of housing where residents own and manage the property together. They can be a helpful way to develop and preserve affordable housing, as well as to build community.<br><br>8.

They can be a useful way to add affordable housing units to a community.<br><br>9. Encourage homeownership<br>Owning a home is one of the best ways to build wealth and stability. Communities can encourage homeownership through a variety of initiatives, such as homeownership counseling, down payment assistance programs, and affordable financing options.<br><br>10. Preserve existing affordable housing<br>It is often cheaper and easier to preserve existing affordable housing than it is to build new affordable housing.
