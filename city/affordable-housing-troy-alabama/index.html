This is forcing people to live in overcrowded conditions, and it is also leading to an increase in homelessness. The city needs to find a way to increase the supply of affordable housing, and to make it easier for people to access it.<br><br>Another big challenge is that the quality of affordable housing is often very poor. This is because many landlords are only interested in making a profit, and they do not care about the condition of their properties. This means that tenants have to put up with poor conditions, and it can be very difficult to find a decent place to live.<br><br>The city of Troy is facing a big challenge when it comes to affordable housing.
