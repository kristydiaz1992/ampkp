The median income in the town is $31,000, and the median home value is $56,000. Nearly 60% of the town's residents are renters.<br><br>Due to the high cost of living in many parts of the country, the federal government has established guidelines for what is considered "affordable housing." For a family of four, the maximum monthly rent or mortgage payment that is considered affordable is $1,250. This means that a family of four earning the median income in Idlewild would not be able to afford the median-priced home in the town.<br><br>The issue of affordable housing is one that affects Idlewild and many other small towns across the country. In order to address the issue, the town would need to attract more businesses and industry that would provide higher-paying jobs. Additionally, the town could work with developers to create more affordable housing options for residents.<p><h2>The current state of affordable housing in Idlewild, Michigan and how it's impacting residents.</h2><p><br>There is a severe affordable housing crisis in Idlewild, Michigan. The town has a median income of just $15,000, and the average rent for a two-bedroom apartment is $850. This means that a family of four would have to spend over half of their income just to keep a roof over their heads.<br><br>This crisis is having a major impact on residents. Many are forced to live in substandard housing, or even on the streets. Others are forced to move away from the town they've called home for their entire lives. This is having a devastating effect on the community, and is something that needs to be addressed urgently.<p><h2>The history of affordable housing in Idlewild, Michigan and how it's evolved over time.</h2><p><br>Idlewild is a small town in Michigan that has a long history of affordable housing.

Over the years, the town has continued to be a place where African Americans can afford to own homes. In the 1970s and 1980s, the town was hit hard by the recession and many of the homes fell into disrepair. However, in the past few years, there has been a resurgence in the town and many of the homes are being renovated. The town is now a destination for both tourists and residents alike.<p><h2>The pros and cons of affordable housing in Idlewild, Michigan.</h2><p><br>There are many pros and cons to affordable housing.
