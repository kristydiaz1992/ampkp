      <h2>The need for affordable housing in Stone Mountain, Georgia</h2><p><br>As the cost of living in the Atlanta metro area continues to rise, many families are being forced to move farther away from the city in search of affordable housing. Stone Mountain, Georgia is one of the many suburbs that are seeing an influx of new residents as a result.<br><br>While Stone Mountain does have some affordable housing options, there is still a great need for more. The average rent for a one-bedroom apartment in Stone Mountain is $942, which is significantly higher than the national average of $821. For many families, this price is simply not affordable.<br><br>There are a number of reasons why the cost of housing is so high in Stone Mountain. One of the biggest factors is the lack of availability. The number of units available for rent has not kept up with the population growth, resulting in higher prices.<br><br>Another reason housing costs are so high is because of the quality of the units that are available. Many of the apartments in Stone Mountain are older and in need of repairs. This causes the rent prices to be higher than they would be for similar units in other parts of the country.<br><br>The high cost of housing is putting a strain on families in Stone Mountain. Many are forced to live in substandard conditions because they cannot afford anything better. This is why there is such a great need for affordable housing in Stone Mountain.<br><br>There are a number of organizations working to address the need for affordable housing in Stone Mountain. One of these is the Stone Mountain Housing Authority, which is working to provide quality, affordable housing options for families in need.<br><br>If you are interested in helping to address the need for affordable housing in Stone Mountain, there are a number of ways you can get involved.

The city has a number of large apartment complexes, but these tend to be quite expensive. There are also a limited number of single-family homes available for rent or purchase, which can make it difficult to find a place to call home.<br><br>Finally, another challenge that comes along with finding affordable housing in Stone Mountain is the lack of public transportation options. The city does have a MARTA station, but it is located quite a distance from many of the city's residential areas.

This can add to the cost of living in Stone Mountain, as well as the city's congestion problems.<p><h2>The impact of affordable housing on the Stone Mountain, Georgia community</h2><p><br>The impact of affordable housing on the Stone Mountain, Georgia community is significant.
