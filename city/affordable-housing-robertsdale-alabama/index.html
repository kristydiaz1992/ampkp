The city has established a Housing Affordability Task Force to examine the issue and make recommendations. The task force is made up of city officials, local business leaders, and residents.<br><br>The task force has identified several possible solutions to the problem of unaffordable housing. One solution is to create more affordable housing units. The city could do this by working with developers to create new developments that include a mix of affordable and market-rate units. Another solution is to provide financial assistance to low- and moderate-income households to help them with down payments and other costs associated with buying a home. The city could also adopt zoning regulations that would require new developments to include a certain percentage of affordable units.<br><br>The task force is still in the process of examining the issue and developing recommendations.

Many residents are struggling to find affordable housing options, and the city's vacancy rate is only 3%.<br><br>One of the main challenges is that Robertsdale is a small city, and there is not a lot of available land for new development.

One option is for the city to invest in more affordable housing developments. This could be done by offering tax incentives to developers or by using city-owned land to build new housing. Another solution is for the city to work with local employers to create more jobs that pay a living wage.
