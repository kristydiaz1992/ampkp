Additionally, affordable housing can help to reduce crime rates and improve overall quality of life for residents.<br><br>On the downside, affordable housing can sometimes lead to increased traffic and noise levels, as well as more competition for resources like schools and parks.

In 2016, the median rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Orange was $1,890, which is 28 percent higher than the national average. The high cost of housing forces families to make difficult choices, such as forgoing healthcare or skimping on food.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing also impacts the local economy.

In 2016, the City Council adopted an inclusionary housing ordinance that requires new developments to set aside a certain percentage of units for low- and moderate-income households.

To date, the fund has helped create or preserve over 1,000 affordable homes in Orange.<br><br>The affordable housing crisis is a complex issue that requires a multi-faceted approach. The City of Orange is committed to working on all fronts to address the needs of our residents and to create a more vibrant and prosperous community for all.<p>
