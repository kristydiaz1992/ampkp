The median home price in Horn Lake is about $128,000, which is significantly higher than the state median of $100,000. And, according to the Mississippi Housing Partnership, nearly 30% of Horn Lake residents are "cost-burdened," meaning they spend more than 30% of their income on housing.<br><br>There are a number of strategies that the city and its residents can pursue to try to increase the availability of affordable housing.<br><br>One option is for the city to create or fund a "housing trust fund." This is a pot of money that can be used to create or preserve affordable housing. The money can come from a variety of sources, including private donations, government grants, and fees collected from developers.<br><br>Another strategy is for the city to work with developers to create "inclusionary housing" developments. These are developments that set aside a certain percentage of units for low- and moderate-income residents. In exchange for this, the developers may be able to get density bonuses or other incentives from the city.<br><br>The city can also adopt policies that encourage the development of accessory dwelling units (ADUs). ADUs are small, secondary units on single-family lots. They can be used as rental units, in-law units, or even short-term rentals (like Airbnb). By increasing the supply of ADUs, the city can help to increase the availability of affordable housing.<br><br>Finally, the city can work with nonprofits and other organizations to provide "wraparound services" for residents. These services can include things like financial counseling, job training, and childcare. By providing these services, the city can help residents to stabilize their lives and make it easier for them to afford housing.<br><br>All of these strategies can help to increase the availability of affordable housing in Horn Lake. By pursing a mix of these strategies, the city can make progress towards its goal of ensuring that everyone has a place to call home.<p><h2>Affordable Housing in Horn Lake: 5 Tips to Save Money</h2><p><br><br>Looking for affordable housing in Horn Lake?
