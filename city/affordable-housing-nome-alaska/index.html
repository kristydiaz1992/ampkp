With its stunning views and abundance of natural resources, it's easy to see why so many people are drawn to this remote corner of the world. However, the high cost of living in Nome can make it difficult for some people to make ends meet.<br><br>One way to make affordable housing a reality in Nome is to encourage more development of workforce housing.

The majority of the residents are of Inupiat descent and the town is located just south of the Arctic Circle. Despite its small size, Nome has become a hub for regional transportation and commerce. It is also the terminus of the famous Iditarod sled dog race. <br><br>The cost of living in Nome is relatively high, due in part to the town's remote location. Housing costs are also high, with the average price for a two-bedroom apartment exceeding $2,000 per month.

The influx of people has increased the demand for housing, driving up prices and making it difficult for many people to find affordable housing.<br><br>There are a number of different ways that the city could address this issue, such as increasing the supply of housing, providing financial assistance to low-income residents, or creating zoning regulations that would restrict the development of luxury housing.
