      <h2>15 cheap and easy ways to make your rental unit more affordable</h2><p><br>There's no need to spend a lot of money to make your rental unit more affordable. Here are 15 cheap and easy ways to do it:<br><br>1. Get energy-efficient appliances: ENERGY STAR® certified appliances use less energy, which can save you money on your utility bills.<br><br>2. Install a programmable thermostat: A programmable thermostat can help you save money by automatically setting the temperature back when you’re not home.<br><br>3. Use LED light bulbs: LED light bulbs use less energy than traditional incandescent light bulbs, and can last up to 25 times longer.<br><br>4. Use a power strip: Plugging all your electronics into a power strip that you can turn off when you’re not using them can help save energy and money.<br><br>5. Unplug electronics when you’re not using them: Even if an electronic is turned off, it can still use energy if it’s plugged in. So be sure to unplug electronics when you’re not using them.<br><br>6. Seal air leaks: Drafty windows and doors can let heat out in the winter and cool air out in the summer, costing you money. Sealing air leaks with weatherstripping or caulk can help reduce your energy bills.<br><br>7. Use a space heater: If you have a room that’s not used often, using a space heater to heat it instead of your whole home can save you money.<br><br>8. Add insulation: Adding insulation to your home can help keep heat in during the winter and cool air in during the summer.<br><br>9. Get a window air conditioner: Window air conditioners are a more affordable option than central air conditioning, and can still keep your home cool during the summer.<br><br>10. Use a ceiling fan: Ceiling fans can help circulate air in your home, and can make you feel cooler without having to lower the temperature.<br><br>11. Dress for the weather: Wearing layers of clothing or light-colored clothing can help you stay comfortable without having to raise the temperature.<br><br>12. Use window treatments: Closing curtains or blinds during the hottest part of the day can help keep your home cooler.<br><br>13. Use a slow cooker: Slow cookers use less energy than ovens, and can help you save money on your utility bills.<br><br>14. Hang clothes to dry: Using a clothesline or drying rack to air-dry your clothes instead of using a clothes dryer can save you money.<br><br>15.
