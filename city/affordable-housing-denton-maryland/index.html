The town was founded in the early 1800s and quickly became a prosperous fishing and farming community. In the late 1800s, the town began to grow rapidly, due in part to the construction of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad. This growth continued into the early 20th century, and by the mid-1900s, Denton was a thriving community with a variety of businesses and a population of over 5,000.<br><br>However, in the latter half of the 20th century, Denton's fortunes began to decline. The town's economy became increasingly reliant on the paper mill, which was the town's largest employer. However, the paper mill began to experience financial difficulties in the 1970s, and in 1982, it closed its doors for good. This had a devastating effect on Denton, as the town lost its largest employer and many residents began to leave in search of work elsewhere.<br><br>The town has struggled in the years since the paper mill closures, but there are signs of hope. In recent years, there has been an increase in investment and redevelopment in downtown Denton. Additionally, the town has been working to attract new businesses and residents.
