Rents in Byron have been rising faster than incomes, and there is a shortage of apartments that families can afford. This has led to a vicious cycle: As more families are forced into homelessness, the demand for shelter increases, driving up the cost of shelter and making it even harder for families to find affordable housing.<br><br>The affordable housing crisis is taking a toll on the entire community. It is time for elected officials, business leaders, and ordinary citizens to come together and find solutions.<p><h2> The future of affordable housing in Byron, Illinois</h2><p><br><br>The future of affordable housing in Byron, Illinois is looking bright.

One is to create a new Housing Trust Fund that will provide financing for affordable housing projects. The city is also working on adopting an inclusionary zoning ordinance that would require new developments to include a certain percentage of affordable units.<br><br>Byron is also fortunate to have a number of community partners that are committed to increasing the supply of affordable housing. The Housing Authority of the City of Byron, for example, is currently working on a new development that will provide 33 units of affordable housing for low- and moderate-income families.<br><br>With all of these efforts, it is clear that the city is committed to ensuring that everyone has access to safe, affordable housing.
