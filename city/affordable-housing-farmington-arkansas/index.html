      <h2> Farmington's Affordable Housing Crisis</h2><p><br>Farmington is facing an affordable housing crisis. The city's median home price has increased by nearly 50% in the past five years, while the median income has only increased by about 10%. This has made it increasingly difficult for working families to find housing they can afford.<br><br>There are a number of factors that have contributed to the city's housing crisis. The first is the strong economy. Farmington is part of the Silicon Valley boom, and job growth has been strong in recent years. This has led to an influx of people moving to the area in search of work. The second factor is the lack of available land. Farmington is a small city, and there is not a lot of land available for new development. This has made it difficult for builders to keep up with the demand for new housing.<br><br>The city is working on a number of solutions to the housing crisis.
