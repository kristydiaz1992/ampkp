      <h2>The current state of affordable housing in Aurora, Minnesota</h2><p><br>Aurora, Minnesota is a city in Hennepin County, and a suburb of the Twin Cities. The median house price in Aurora is $284,900, which is an increase of 8.3% from last year. The median rent price in Aurora is $1,395, which is an increase of 3.7% from last year. The average apartment rent in Aurora is $1,056, which is an increase of 2.5% from last year.<br><br>The current state of affordable housing in Aurora, Minnesota is not good. The median house price is increasing at a faster rate than the median rent price, and the average apartment rent is also increasing. This means that it is becoming more difficult for people to find affordable housing in Aurora. There are a limited number of affordable housing units available, and the waitlists for these units are often very long. The city is working on increasing the supply of affordable housing, but it will take time to make a significant impact. In the meantime, people who need affordable housing will continue to struggle to find it in Aurora.<p><h2>The history of affordable housing in Aurora, Minnesota</h2><p><br>Aurora, Minnesota is a city with a rich history of affordable housing. The city was founded in 1856 as a stop on the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railroad. The city was named after the Roman goddess of the dawn, Aurora. The city was originally settled by Swedish immigrants who were looking for farmland. The city grew rapidly during the early 20th century, due in part to the construction of the Grand Army of the Republic Memorial Hall. The hall was built to honor veterans of the Civil War and was the largest such structure in the world at the time.<br><br>The city's population exploded during World War II as the Great Lakes Naval Training Station was built nearby. Aurora became a bedroom community for the thousands of servicemen who were stationed at the base. After the war, many of these servicemen settled in Aurora and the city became a haven for middle-class families.<br><br>The city has always been known for its affordable housing. In the 1950s, Aurora was one of the first cities in the country to develop a housing cooperative. The cooperative was developed to provide affordable housing for the city's growing population. The cooperative is still in operation today and provides affordable housing for hundreds of families.<br><br>Aurora has also been a leader in developing affordable housing for senior citizens. In the 1970s, the city developed the Aurora Senior Citizens Housing Cooperative. This cooperative provides affordable housing for seniors on a fixed income. The cooperative is still in operation today and provides housing for hundreds of seniors.<br><br>The city of Aurora is committed to providing affordable housing for its citizens.

The city has experienced rapid population growth in recent years, but the supply of housing has not kept up with the demand.

Many residents are being priced out of their homes and are being forced to move to other cities. This is having a negative impact on the local economy and is causing social and economic inequality to increase.<br><br>The city council's plan to build more affordable housing is a step in the right direction, but it is only a short-term solution to the problem.
