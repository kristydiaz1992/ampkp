This is especially true for young people and families who are struggling to make ends meet. The lack of affordable housing is a major problem in our city and we need to do something about it.<br><br>One of the biggest reasons for the lack of affordable housing is the fact that there is so much demand for it.

This means that there is simply not enough housing to go around, which drives up prices.<br><br>Another reason for the lack of affordable housing is that a lot of the housing that is available is not suitable for families or people with low incomes. Luxury apartments and houses are being built all over the city, while there is very little being done to provide housing for those who need it most. This is unfair and it needs to change.<br><br>We need to build more affordable housing in Geneva.

It is time for our leaders to take action and make this a priority.<p><h2>The Impact of Affordable Housing on Geneva's Economy</h2><p><br>Geneva is a city in southwestern Switzerland that is known for its banks and international organizations.
