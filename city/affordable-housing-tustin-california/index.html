In Tustin, California, a suburb of Orange County, the median home price is now over $800,000. For many families, this price tag is simply too high.<br><br>Fortunately, Tustin is one of the few cities in Orange County that still has some affordable housing options. The city has a variety of programs and initiatives in place to help residents find safe and affordable housing.<br><br>One such program is the Tustin Community Land Trust. The Land Trust is a non-profit organization that helps residents purchase homes through a unique lease-to-own program. The program is open to all residents, regardless of income.<br><br>Under the program, residents can purchase a home for below-market prices. The Land Trust then leases the home to the resident for a set period of time, typically five to seven years. At the end of the lease, the resident has the option to purchase the home outright or renew the lease.<br><br>This program has helped many Tustin residents realize their dream of homeownership. In fact, over 90% of participants have been able to purchase their home at the end of the lease period.<br><br>The Tustin Community Land Trust is just one of the many affordable housing options available in the city. Tustin also has a variety of income-restricted housing developments, including senior apartments and townhomes.<br><br>For families struggling to find affordable housing in Tustin, these programs and developments offer a much-needed lifeline.
