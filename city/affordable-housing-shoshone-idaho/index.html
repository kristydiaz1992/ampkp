According to a report by the National Low Income Housing Coalition, a person working full-time in Shoshone would need to earn $17.42 per hour to afford a modest two-bedroom apartment. That's more than double the minimum wage in Idaho, which is just $7.25 per hour.<br><br>There are a number of factors that contribute to the high cost of housing in Shoshone. The first is that there's simply not enough housing to meet the demand. This has driven up prices and made it difficult for people to find a place to live.<br><br>Another factor is that Shoshone is a popular tourist destination. This means that there are a lot of people who want to live in the area, but there aren't enough homes for them. This has also driven up prices and made it difficult for people to find a place to live.<br><br>The last factor is that Shoshone is a small town. This means that there are fewer options for people when it comes to housing. There are fewer apartments, for example, and fewer homes for sale. This lack of options can make it difficult and expensive for people to find a place to live.<br><br>All of these factors make it difficult for people to find affordable housing in Shoshone. It's a struggle that many people are facing, and it's one that doesn't seem to be getting any easier.<p><h2>The hidden costs of affordable housing in Shoshone</h2><p><br>Shoshone is a city in Idaho with a population of about 3,000 people. The median home value in Shoshone is $64,700, which is much lower than the national average of $205,000. The median rent in Shoshone is $545, which is also lower than the national average of $1,000.<br><br>There are many hidden costs of affordable housing in Shoshone. One of the biggest hidden costs is the lack of quality. Most affordable housing units in Shoshone are old and in poor condition. They may have mold, mildew, or other problems that make them unhealthy to live in.<br><br>Another hidden cost of affordable housing is the lack of safety. Many affordable housing units are located in high-crime areas. This means that residents of affordable housing are more likely to be victims of crime.<br><br>Lastly, affordable housing often comes with strict rules and regulations. This can make it difficult for residents to live a normal life. For example, some affordable housing developments have curfews that residents must obey. This can make it difficult for people to work or go to school if they have to be home by a certain time.<br><br>The hidden costs of affordable housing can be significant. However, it is important to remember that not all affordable housing is bad. There are many quality affordable housing units in Shoshone. It is important to do your research to find the right affordable housing option for you.<p><h2>Are there any affordable housing options left in Shoshone ?</h2><p><br><br>Yes, there are still affordable housing options left in Shoshone.
