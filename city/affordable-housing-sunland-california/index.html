The high cost of housing is pricing out middle- and working-class families, and this is having a detrimental effect on the social fabric of our communities.<br><br>There are a number of possible solutions to the affordable housing crisis, but finding the political will to implement them is proving to be a challenge. In Sunland, we need to come together as a community and advocate for solutions that will make housing more affordable for all.<p>
