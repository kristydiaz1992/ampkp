According to a recent report from the Maine Housing Partnership, the average cost of a home in Ocean Park is now $284,000, which is an increase of nearly 5% from last year. This trend is likely to continue, as the demand for housing in the area continues to outpace the supply.<br><br>One way that Ocean Park could address the issue of affordable housing is by increasing the number of accessory dwelling units (ADUs) in the town. ADUs are small, secondary residences that are typically attached to or located on the same property as a primary residence. They can be an effective way to increase the housing supply in an area without sacrificing quality of life or increasing density.<br><br>Another way that Ocean Park could address the issue of affordable housing is by working with developers to create mixed-use developments. These are projects that combine residential, commercial, and/or office space into a single development. Mixed-use developments can help to meet the needs of a community by providing a variety of housing options, while also creating a more walkable and lively environment.<br><br>Both of these solutions would require cooperation from the town government, as well as landowners and developers. However, if implemented, they could help to increase the supply of affordable housing in Ocean Park and make the town more affordable for everyone.<p>
