The cost of a two-bedroom apartment in Wells has increased by nearly 20% since 2000, while the median income has only increased by 9%.<br><br>This means that more and more families are being forced to spend a larger portion of their income on housing, leaving less money for other essentials like food, healthcare, and transportation.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing is not just a problem for low-income families. It affects everyone in the community. When families are struggling to make ends meet, they are less likely to participate in the local economy, which can lead to a decline in business and an overall decrease in the quality of life in the community.<br><br>Wells is a community that values its residents and wants to see them thrive. By increasing the availability of affordable housing, we can help our neighbors to meet their basic needs and participate fully in the life of our community.<p>
