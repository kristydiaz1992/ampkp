The population was 8,475 at the 2010 census, up from 7,456 at the 2000 census.<br><br>Guadalupe is located on U.S. Route 101, 12 miles (19 km) north of Santa Maria and about 60 miles (97 km) northwest of Los Angeles.<br><br>The city is about 10 miles (16 km) inland from the Pacific Ocean.<br><br>Guadalupe is a mostly agricultural community, known for its strawberry fields. The city is also home to a large number of Latino residents.<br><br>The median income for a household in the city was $37,065, and the median income for a family was $42,115. Males had a median income of $31,750 versus $23,438 for females. The per capita income for the city was $15,257. About 11.8% of families and 16.1% of the population were below the poverty line, including 22.9% of those under age 18 and 5.8% of those age 65 or over.<br><br>Guadalupe has a high rate of poverty and a lack of affordable housing. According to the Santa Barbara County Economic Development Commission, the median rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Guadalupe is $1,500, which is out of reach for many residents. The median household income in Guadalupe is $37,065, which is below the Santa Barbara County median of $70,873.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing in Guadalupe is exacerbated by the high cost of living in Santa Barbara County. The median home price in the county is $752,500, which is out of reach for many residents.<br><br>The high cost of living and lack of affordable housing is a major challenge for residents of Guadalupe. Many residents are forced to live in substandard housing or to commute long distances to work.

With the support of the community, it is possible that the challenges of affordable housing in Guadalupe can be overcome.<p><h2>How affordable housing is changing the face of Guadalupe</h2><p><br><br>Guadalupe is a neighborhood on the Eastside of Austin, Texas that is rapidly changing. Once an affordable housing option for working families and immigrants, Guadalupe is becoming increasingly gentrified. As Austin continues to grow and gentrify, working families are being pushed out of the city center and into the suburbs. This is resulting in longer commutes and less access to jobs, schools, and other city amenities.<br><br>The increased cost of living in Austin is also causing families to reconsider their housing options. More and more families are finding that they can no longer afford to live in the city and are being forced to move to the suburbs or even out of state. This is having a profound impact on the demographics of the city and is changing the face of Guadalupe.<br><br>There is no question that affordable housing is a critical issue in Austin. The city is growing quickly and working families are being priced out of the neighborhoods they have called home for generations. This is resulting in increased segregation and a city that is becoming increasingly divided.<br><br>It is critical that we find solutions to the affordable housing crisis in Austin. We need to ensure that working families can remain in the city and that they have access to quality housing options. Otherwise, we risk losing the diversity and vibrancy that make Austin such a special place.<p>
