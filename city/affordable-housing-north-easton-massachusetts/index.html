In the early days of the town, there were a number of small farms and homesteads that were passed down from generation to generation. These families were able to keep their homes and land affordable because they were not burdened by the high taxes and expenses that come with living in a more urban area.<br><br>As the town grew and more people moved in, the need for affordable housing became more apparent. In the late 1800s, a number of philanthropists and businessmen built a number of tenement buildings in North Easton specifically for low-income residents. These buildings were well-maintained and offered residents a safe and affordable place to live.<br><br>Over the years, the face of affordable housing in North Easton has changed quite a bit. In the 1950s and 1960s, a number of public housing projects were built in the town. These projects were designed to provide safe and affordable housing for families of all income levels.
