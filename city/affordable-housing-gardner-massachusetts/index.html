      <h2>The hidden costs of affordable housing in Gardner, Massachusetts</h2><p><br>There are many affordable housing options in Gardner, Massachusetts, but what are the hidden costs?<br><br> affordability is often relative. For example, while a family earning $30,000 per year may be able to find affordable housing in Gardner, they may have to sacrifice other needs, such as food and transportation, in order to make ends meet.<br><br>Furthermore, affordable housing options may be located in neighborhoods that are not as desirable as other areas of town. This can impact a family's quality of life and their ability to access jobs, schools, and other important resources.<br><br>Ultimately, while affordable housing options may be available in Gardner, it is important to consider the hidden costs before making a decision. Otherwise, a family may find themselves struggling to make ends meet and sacrificing their quality of life.<p><h2>The fight for affordable housing in Gardner, Massachusetts</h2><p><br>It's no secret that the cost of housing in Massachusetts is high. And Gardner is no exception. The cost of housing here has been rising steadily for years, and shows no signs of slowing down.

In fact, nearly one-quarter of households in the city are earning less than $25,000 per year.<br><br>There are a number of factors that have contributed to the high cost of housing in Gardner. The first is the lack of available housing. The city has a very low vacancy rate, which means there are few apartments or homes available for families to move into. The second is the high cost of construction. The price of lumber and other building materials has skyrocketed in recent years, making it very expensive to build new housing.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing is having a major impact on the lives of residents in Gardner. Families are being forced to live in overcrowded conditions, and many are even homeless. The high cost of housing is also putting a strain on the city's budget. Gardner is currently spending more than $1 million per year to subsidize the construction of new affordable housing.<br><br>The need for affordable housing is a critical issue in Gardner and across the state.
