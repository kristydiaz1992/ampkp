The city is one of the poorest in the nation, with a median household income of just $22,000. Nearly half of its residents live below the poverty line. And yet, Gulfport is also one of the most expensive places to live in Mississippi, with a cost of living that is nearly 20% higher than the national average.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing is one of the biggest challenges facing Gulfport residents. According to a recent study, nearly 60% of Gulfport renters spend more than 30% of their income on rent, which is considered to be "cost-burdened." This means that they have very little money left over for other expenses, such as food, transportation, and healthcare.<br><br>There are several reasons why housing is so expensive in Gulfport. One is that there is a limited supply of affordable housing. This is due in part to the city's strict zoning laws, which make it difficult to build new housing developments. As a result, apartment rents have soared in recent years.<br><br>Another reason for the high cost of housing in Gulfport is the city's lack of investment in public housing. According to a recent report, Gulfport has the lowest number of public housing units per capita of any city in Mississippi. This lack of investment has led to a deterioration of existing public housing, making it even more difficult for low-income residents to find affordable places to live.<br><br>One of the biggest challenges facing Gulfport is the need to create more affordable housing. This will require a concerted effort from city leaders, developers, and the business community. It will also require a significant investment of public funds. But if Gulfport is to become a more prosperous and livable city, it is an investment that is well worth making.<p>
