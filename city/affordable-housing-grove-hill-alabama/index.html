In 2017, the city adopted an inclusionary zoning ordinance that requires new developments to set aside a certain percentage of units for low- and moderate-income residents. However, this ordinance has only been partially successful, as many developers have been able to get around it.<br><br>The city also needs to do more to encourage the development of affordable housing. One way to do this is by offering incentives to developers who build units that are affordable for low- and moderate-income residents.
