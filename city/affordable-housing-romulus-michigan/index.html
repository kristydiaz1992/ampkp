This is especially important for low-income families, who often have to make difficult choices about how to spend their limited resources.<br><br>The city of Romulus is also seeing a boost in economic activity thanks to the increased demand for housing.

According to a report from the National Low Income Housing Coalition, a family of four would need to earn a combined income of $77,600 just to afford a two-bedroom apartment in the city.<br><br>Unfortunately, the median household income in Romulus is just $44,875, meaning that most families are unable to afford even the most basic housing. This has led to a rise in homelessness and housing insecurity, as well as an increase in the number of families living in overcrowded or substandard housing.<br><br>The city has been working to address the problem, but progress has been slow. In 2017, the Romulus City Council approved a housing trust fund that will provide $500,000 to help create or preserve affordable housing. However, this is just a drop in the bucket compared to the need.<br><br>The city has also been working with developers to create more affordable housing options, but again, progress has been slow. In 2018, the city approved a tax abatement for a new development that will include some units of affordable housing, but it will take years for this project to come to fruition.<br><br>In the meantime, families in Romulus will continue to struggle to find affordable housing. This struggle takes a toll on their physical and mental health, their ability to work and go to school, and their overall quality of life. It is an issue that needs to be addressed urgently in order to improve the lives of residents in Romulus and ensure that the city remains a thriving community for everyone.<p>
