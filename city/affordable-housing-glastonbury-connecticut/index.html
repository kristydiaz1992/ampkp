That’s nearly double the state’s median income of $60,336.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing can have a number of negative impacts on the community. For one, it can lead to an increase in crime as people are forced to live in cramped, unsafe conditions or on the streets. It can also strain the town’s resources, as residents struggling to pay rent may rely on public assistance programs or end up homeless.<br><br>The town is currently working on a number of initiatives to address the affordable housing issue, including creating a new housing trust fund and working with developers to create more affordable units. However, there is still more work to be done to ensure that everyone in Glastonbury has a safe, affordable place to call home.<p><h2> How has affordable housing changed over the years in Glastonbury, Connecticut?</h2><p><br><br>In Glastonbury, Connecticut, affordable housing has changed significantly over the years. The town has long been known for its many affordable housing options, but in recent years, the number of affordable housing units has decreased significantly. According to the town's website, the number of affordable housing units has decreased from over 1,200 in 2010 to just over 600 in 2016. The town attributes this decrease to the rising cost of living in the area and the lack of available land for new development. While the town has approved several new developments in recent years, the units that have been built have been mostly luxury apartments and condos that are out of reach for many residents. The town is currently working on a new affordable housing plan that will create more units and help to address the issue.<p>
