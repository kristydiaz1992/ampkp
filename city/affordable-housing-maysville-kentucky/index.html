      <h2> The Reality of Affordable Housing in Maysville</h2><p><br>There is a lot of talk about affordable housing these days, but what does that really mean? In Maysville, affordable housing is defined as housing that costs no more than 30% of a household’s income. For a family of four earning the median income in Maysville, that’s $45,000 a year.<br><br>According to the most recent data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the median rent in Maysville is $735 per month. That means a family of four would have to spend $2,145 per month on housing, which is almost half of their income. And that’s just for rent. It doesn’t include utilities, food, clothing, transportation, or anything else.<br><br>There is a severe shortage of affordable housing in Maysville. In fact, only about 28% of Maysville residents live in housing that is affordable. The other 72% are either spending too much of their income on housing or are living in substandard housing.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing is a major problem in Maysville.
