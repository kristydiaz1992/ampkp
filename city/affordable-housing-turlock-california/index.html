The population was 64,792 at the 2010 census. Turlock is located in California's San Joaquin Valley, 28 miles (45km) south of Modesto and 53.5 miles (86.1km) north of Merced.<br><br>One of the main issues Turlock is facing is the lack of affordable housing. The city's median home value is $270,700, which is significantly higher than the state median of $393,000. The high cost of housing is preventing many people from moving to Turlock, which is limiting the city's growth.<br><br>One way to make Turlock more affordable for people of all income levels is to create more affordable housing options.

This has led to a number of challenges for those who are trying to find affordable housing in Turlock, California.<br><br>The first challenge is that there is simply not enough affordable housing available. The vacancy rate for rentals in Turlock is only 2.8%, which means that there are very few options available for those who are looking for an affordable place to live.<br><br>The second challenge is that the prices of the few affordable units that are available are increasing at an alarming rate. In the past year, the average rent for an apartment in Turlock has increased by 14%. This is far outpacing the rate of inflation, and is making it very difficult for people on fixed incomes to keep up.<br><br>The third challenge is that many of the people who are looking for affordable housing in Turlock are also looking for jobs. The unemployment rate in Turlock is currently at 8.4%, which is higher than the national average. This makes it difficult for people to find work, and then afford the housing that is available.<br><br>The fourth challenge is that there are few resources available to help people find affordable housing in Turlock. There are no government programs or non-profit organizations that are specifically devoted to this issue. This makes it difficult for people to know where to turn for help.<br><br>The fifth challenge is that the city of Turlock is not doing enough to address the issue of affordable housing. The city council has made it a priority to attract new businesses to the city, but has not made any real effort to address the issue of housing. This is frustrating for many people who are struggling to find a place to live.<br><br>The challenges of affordable housing in Turlock are significant, but they are not insurmountable. With a little effort, the city can make a difference for the people who are struggling to find a place to live.<p><h2>Finding affordable housing in Turlock, California: one family's story</h2><p><br>My family and I recently moved to Turlock, California, in search of more affordable housing.
