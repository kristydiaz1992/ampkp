However, there are plenty of smaller towns and cities across the country that are struggling with the same issue. One of those towns is Frostburg, Maryland.<br><br>Frostburg is a small city located in the Appalachian Mountains. The city has a population of just over 8,000 people. The median household income is $32,000 and the median rent is $600. That means that a family would have to spend nearly one-fifth of their income just to keep a roof over their head.<br><br>There are a number of reasons why affordable housing is such a challenge in Frostburg. First of all, the town is located in a rural area. That means that there are few jobs and the ones that are available don’t pay very well. Second, the town is also home to a large number of students from Frostburg State University. The presence of the university drives up the cost of housing since there is more demand for apartments and houses.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing in Frostburg has led to a number of problems for the town’s residents. For example, many people are forced to live in substandard housing. This can lead to health problems and a general decline in the quality of life. Additionally, the lack of affordable housing can also lead to an increase in crime. When people are struggling to make ends meet, they may turn to illegal activities in order to survive.<br><br>The challenges of living in affordable housing in Frostburg are significant. However, the town is working to find solutions. The city has created a task force to study the issue and to come up with potential solutions. Additionally, a number of non-profit organizations are working to provide affordable housing options for the city’s residents. With time and effort, the town of Frostburg can find a way to provide its residents with quality, affordable housing.<p><h2>A day in the life of someone living in affordable housing in Frostburg</h2><p><br><br><br><br>It's 6 a.m. and time to start the day. But first, a quick check of the budget. Housing in Frostburg is affordable, but it's still important to make sure that all the bills are paid and there's enough food in the fridge.<br><br>The morning routine starts with getting the kids ready for school. It's a juggling act, getting them dressed and fed while also getting yourself ready for the day. But it's all worth it when you see them off at the bus stop with a smile on their face.<br><br>Then it's time to head to work. For many people in Frostburg, work is a long commute away. But the affordable housing options in the city make it possible to live here and work in a bigger city.<br><br>The day is long, but it's nice to come home to a place that you can call your own. There's always something to do in Frostburg, whether it's grabbing a bite to eat at one of the local restaurants or taking a walk in the park.<br><br>It's been a long day, but it's a good day. A day where you're grateful for your affordable housing in Frostburg and all that it allows you to do.<p>
