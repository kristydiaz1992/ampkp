Low income families may also struggle to pay for child care, transportation, and other basic needs.<br><br>The federal government defines poverty as a family of four earning less than $25,000 per year, or a single individual earning less than $12,500 per year. According to this definition, there are approximately 45 million people living in poverty in the United States. This includes 15 million children.<br><br>Child poverty is especially concerning, as children who grow up in poverty are more likely to experience health problems, have lower test scores and graduation rates, and earn less as adults. They are also more likely to become involved in the criminal justice system.<br><br>There are a number of programs and policies in place that are designed to help low income families, including the Earned Income Tax Credit, food assistance programs, and housing subsidies. However, many families still struggle to make ends meet.<br><br>If you are part of a low income family, there are a number of things that you can do to help make your life easier.

In addition to struggling to pay for basic necessities like food and shelter, they may also have difficulty affording child care, transportation, and healthcare. Low-income families may also have trouble accessing quality education and job opportunities, which can make it difficult to break the cycle of poverty.<br><br>There are a number of programs and initiatives that can help low-income families get back on their feet. For example, the Earned Income Tax Credit is a federal tax credit that can help low- and moderate-income workers offset the cost of living. There are also programs that can help with transportation, child care, and housing costs. And, of course, there are always community resources like food banks and free or low-cost clinics.<br><br>If you are a low-income family struggling to make ends meet, don't hesitate to reach out for help.

A study done in 2017 showed that there was a lack of 7.2 million affordable and available rental homes for extremely low income renters. This number is only increasing as rent and housing prices continue to rise.<br><br>This is a problem that hits extremely close to home for many income families. They are often forced to spend a large portion of their income on housing, leaving little to no room for other essentials like food or healthcare. This can often lead to a cycle of poverty that is hard to break out of.<br><br>There are a few different ways that income families can find quality, affordable housing. One option is to search for government-sponsored housing programs. These programs are usually income-based, meaning that families will only have to pay a certain percentage of their income towards rent. Another option is to look for housing in areas with a lower cost of living. This can often be found in smaller cities or rural areas.<br><br>Finding quality, affordable housing is a challenge for many income families in the United States. However, there are a few different options available to those who are willing to look for them. With a little bit of research, it is possible to find a place to call home that won’t break the bank.<p><h2> The Bushnell Housing Authority can help you find affordable housing in Bushnell, Illinois.</h2><p><br><br>There are a number of different affordable housing options available in Bushnell, Illinois.
