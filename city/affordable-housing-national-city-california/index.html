      <h2>The Impact of Affordable Housing on National City Residents</h2><p><br>There is no one silver bullet to addressing the affordable housing crisis in America today.  However, many believe that one key to success is creating more affordable housing units in our cities. <br><br>According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, the average hourly wage needed to afford a modest, two-bedroom rental home is $19.35.  In order to make ends meet, a family would need to be earning almost three times the federal minimum wage of $7.25. <br><br>The high cost of housing is not only a problem for low-income families.  A report from the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University found that the number of middle-income renters spending more than 30% of their income on housing has increased from 24% in 2001 to 31% in 2016. <br><br>The impact of the affordable housing crisis is far-reaching.  When families are forced to spend an increasingly large portion of their income on housing, they have less money available to spend on other necessities like food, clothing, and healthcare. This can lead to a decrease in quality of life and, in some cases, homelessness.<br><br>The problem of affordable housing is not going to be solved overnight.  However, by working to create more affordable housing units, we can start to make a dent in the problem.  In doing so, we will not only be helping families in need, but we will also be helping to strengthen our cities and our economy.<p><h2>How Affordable Housing is Helping to Address Homelessness in National City</h2><p><br>The city of National City is working hard to address the issue of homelessness within its borders.
