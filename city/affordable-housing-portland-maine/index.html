The average monthly mortgage payment in the city is $1,400.<br><br>With the cost of living rising and wages staying the same, it's no wonder that Portland's affordable housing crisis is only getting worse.<br><br>According to a report from the Maine State Housing Authority, the number of Portland households earning less than $25,000 a year has increased by 33 percent since 2000. And, the number of households spending more than 30 percent of their income on housing has increased by 23 percent.<br><br>There are a number of reasons why the cost of housing in Portland is so high. The city has seen a boom in tourism in recent years, which has led to an increase in demand for housing. Additionally, the cost of construction and land development has gone up, while the availability of affordable housing has gone down.<br><br>The city has been working on a number of initiatives to try to address the affordable housing crisis, but so far, the problem has only gotten worse. In 2017, Portland voters approved a $64 million bond to fund affordable housing, but the city has only been able to build or preserve about 400 units of housing so far.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing is not only a problem for low-income Portlanders, but it is also a problem for the city's economy.

From the way we dress to the way we speak, we are constantly sending out messages about who we are and what we're worth. And unfortunately, if we don't fit into the mold of what society deems as acceptable, we can be left feeling like we're not good enough.<br><br>If you're struggling with poor body image, it's important to remember that you're not alone. In fact, studies have shown that poor body image is becoming more and more common, especially among young women. But just because it's common doesn't mean it's not a problem.<br><br>There are a number of things you can do to improve your body image. First, try to become more accepting of your body. This doesn't mean you have to love your body, but it does mean learning to appreciate it for what it is. Second, focus on your health, not your weight. This means making decisions that are based on what will make you feel good, not what will make you thin. Finally, surround yourself with people who accept and support you, no matter what your size or shape.<br><br>If you're struggling with poor body image, remember that you're not alone and that there are things you can do to improve your situation. With a little effort, you can learn to love and appreciate your body, no matter what society says.<p><h2>How to afford a rental in Portland, Maine on a low income</h2><p><br>Finding an affordable rental in any city can be difficult, but if you’re on a low income, it can seem impossible.
