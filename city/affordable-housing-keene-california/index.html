      <h2>The hidden costs of affordable housing in Keene, California</h2><p><br>It's no secret that housing costs in California are high. But what's often overlooked is the hidden costs of affordable housing.<br><br>For families earning low or moderate incomes, the search for affordable housing can be a constant struggle. And even when they do find a place to live, they often have to sacrifice quality and safety for affordability.<br><br>In Keene, California, the median rent for a two-bedroom apartment is $1,600. For a family of four, that's $64,000 a year â€“ well above the area's median income of $53,000.<br><br>There are a number of reasons why housing costs are so high in California. One is the state's strict land-use regulations, which make it difficult to build new housing. Another is the high cost of construction.<br><br>But even if a family is able to find an affordable place to live, there are often other hidden costs that can make it difficult to make ends meet.<br><br>For example, many low-income families live in substandard housing. This can lead to health problems and increased stress levels.<br><br>And even if a family is able to find decent housing, they may still have to deal with long commutes, poor schools, and high crime rates.<br><br>All of these factors can have a profound impact on a family's quality of life.
