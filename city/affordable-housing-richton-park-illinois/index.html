Richton Park, Illinois is currently considering implementing rent control, and there are pros and cons to this decision.<br><br>On the pro side, rent control could potentially help to keep rents affordable for tenants. This is especially important in areas where there is a high demand for housing and not a lot of available units. By capping how much landlords can charge for rent, it prevents them from raising rates too high and pricing out lower-income tenants.<br><br>On the con side, rent control could discourage landlords from investing in their properties. If they know they won't be able to increase rents, they may be less likely to put money into maintaining or improving their units. This could lead to lower-quality housing overall and a decline in the area's desirability.<br><br>Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to implement rent control is a complex one. There are valid arguments on both sides, and it's important to consider all of the potential implications before making a decision.<p>
