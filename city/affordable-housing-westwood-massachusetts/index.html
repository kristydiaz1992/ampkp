In response to this crisis, the City has adopted a number of policies and programs aimed at increasing the production of affordable housing. However, the results of these efforts have been mixed, and the City continues to face a significant shortfall of affordable housing units.<br><br>One of the neighborhoods that has been most affected by the affordable housing crisis is Westwood. Westwood is a densely-populated, urban neighborhood located in the western portion of the City of Los Angeles. The neighborhood is home to a large population of low- and moderate-income households, many of whom are renters. Given the high cost of housing in Westwood and the lack of affordable housing units, many residents are forced to live in substandard housing or to commute long distances to work.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing in Westwood has had a number of negative impacts on the neighborhood. First, it has made it difficult for residents to find safe and decent housing. Second, it has put a strain on the neighborhood’s infrastructure, as overcrowded housing units place a greater demand on public services such as schools and parks. Finally, the lack of affordable housing has contributed to the displacement of long-term residents, as landlords take advantage of the high housing costs to evict tenants and convert units into more expensive condominiums or apartments.<br><br>The City of Los Angeles has taken a number of steps in recent years to try to address the affordable housing crisis in Westwood. In 2015, the City adopted the Westwood Community Plan, which included a number of policies and programs aimed at increasing the production of affordable housing. Among other things, the Plan created new zoning regulations that incentivized the development of affordable housing, and it provided funding for the rehabilitation of existing affordable housing units.<br><br>The City has also created a number of programs that provide financial assistance to low- and moderate-income households who are struggling to pay rent. These programs include the Low Income Housing Tax Credit program, which provides tax breaks to developers who build affordable housing units, and the Housing Choice Voucher program, which helps low-income households pay rent.<br><br>Despite these efforts, the City of Los Angeles still faces a significant shortfall of affordable housing units. In 2018, the City’s Department of City Planning estimated that there was a need for more than 500,000 new affordable housing units. Given the current rate of production, it would take the City more than 20 years to meet this need.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing in Westwood has had a number of negative impacts on the neighborhood.
