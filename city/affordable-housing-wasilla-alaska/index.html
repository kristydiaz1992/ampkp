The state has some of the highest costs of living in the country, which can be a shock to newcomers and a burden to long-time residents. But there are ways to survive—and even thrive—in Alaska's high-cost environment.<br><br>One way to cut costs is to live a more modest lifestyle. This may mean downsizing your home, getting rid of unnecessary luxuries, and learning to live with less. It's also important to be mindful of your spending and to make sure you're not overpaying for goods and services.<br><br>Another way to save money is to take advantage of the state's many free or low-cost resources. For example, Alaska is home to some of the best hiking and camping in the country, and these activities can be enjoyed for little to no cost. Additionally, many communities offer free or low-cost recreation and entertainment options.<br><br>Finally, it's important to remember that the high cost of living in Alaska is offset by the many benefits the state has to offer. These include its natural beauty, its array of outdoor activities, and its friendly and welcoming people. When you take the time to enjoy all that Alaska has to offer, the high cost of living becomes much more bearable.<p><h2> 10 tips for finding affordable housing in Wasilla</h2><p><br>There are a number of ways to find affordable housing in Wasilla.
