      <h2>The need for affordable housing in Anderson, Indiana</h2><p><br>There is a real need for affordable housing in Anderson, Indiana. The city has a high poverty rate and a large number of families who are struggling to make ends meet. Many of the city's residents are forced to live in substandard housing or even on the streets. The problem is only getting worse as the city's population continues to grow.<br><br>The city's government has been working on a plan to address the affordable housing crisis, but they have been met with resistance from some members of the community.
