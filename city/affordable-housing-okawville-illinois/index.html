One potential downside of affordable housing is that it can lead to increased crime and social problems in neighborhoods that are not well-prepared to handle them. <br><br>2. Another concern is that affordable housing developments can sometimes be of poor quality and not well-maintained, which can further drag down the value of surrounding properties. <br><br>3.
