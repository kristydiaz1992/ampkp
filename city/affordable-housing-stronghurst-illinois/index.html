Weâ€™re also strengthening our economy and our communities. According to the National Housing Conference, every $1 invested in affordable housing generates $3 in economic activity.<br><br>So if you care about ensuring that everyone has a fair shot at the American dream, then invest in affordable housing. Itâ€™s good for our families, our economy, and our country.<p>
