      <h2> Patoka's struggle with affordable housing</h2><p><br>Patoka, Indiana is a small town with a big problem: affordable housing. The town has a median household income of just $24,000, and the average rent for a two-bedroom apartment is $865. That's more than three-quarters of the town's residents can afford.<br><br>There are a number of reasons for the town's housing crisis. Patoka is located in a rural area, so there's little new construction. And, many of the town's homes are old and in need of repairs. The town has been trying to attract new businesses and industries, but so far, there hasn't been much success.<br><br>The town's residents are struggling to make ends meet. Some are forced to live in their cars or in tents. Others are forced to work two or three jobs just to pay the rent. And, many of the town's children are living in poverty.<br><br>The town's leaders are trying to find solutions to the housing crisis, but it's a tough problem to solve. They're working with state and federal officials to try to get funding for new housing developments. But, it's a slow process, and the town's residents can't wait much longer for help.<p><h2> Affordable housing developments in Patoka</h2><p><br>Patoka is a small town located in southern Illinois.
