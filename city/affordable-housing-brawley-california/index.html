Low income housing is housing that is affordable to households with low incomes. HUD defines low income as "households earning 80 percent or less of the median income for the area." <br><br>There are several key differences between affordable housing and low income housing. First, affordable housing is not necessarily low income housing. A household can be low income and still not be able to afford housing. Second, affordable housing is typically only available to households that fall below a certain income threshold, whereas low income housing is typically available to all households with low incomes, regardless of income. Third, affordable housing is usually subsidized in some way, either through government programs or private subsidies, whereas low income housing is not typically subsidized. Fourth, affordable housing typically has more strict eligibility requirements than low income housing, in terms of both income and other factors. Finally, affordable housing is typically more expensive than low income housing. <br><br>In general, affordable housing is more expensive than low income housing, but it is also more likely to be available, and it typically has better quality.
