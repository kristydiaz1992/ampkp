      <h2> How to find affordable housing in Adams, Massachusetts</h2><p><br>There is no one-size-fits-all answer to the question of how to find affordable housing in Adams, Massachusetts, as the best way to go about it will vary depending on your specific circumstances and what you are looking for in a home. However, there are a few general tips that can help you start your search:<br><br>1. Check out websites and online resources specifically dedicated to finding affordable housing. A quick Google search will turn up a number of options, such as the Massachusetts Housing Partnership's Affordable Housing Inventory.<br><br>2. Get in touch with local housing organizations and agencies. They will often have information on affordable housing options in the area.<br><br>3. Talk to your friends, family, and co-workers.

The town has a couple of senior citizen housing complexes, but they have long waiting lists. There is also a Section 8 voucher program, but again, the waiting list is very long.
