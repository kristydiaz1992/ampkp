Nearly 40% of the population lives below the poverty line. The city's economy is struggling, and many residents are struggling to make ends meet.<br><br>One of the biggest challenges facing Union is the lack of affordable housing. According to a recent study, only 26% of households in the city are able to afford a typical two-bedroom apartment. This leaves a large portion of the population without a place to call home.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing has a ripple effect on the city's economy.

The cost of living in Union is relatively high, and many families are struggling to make ends meet. In addition, the availability of affordable housing is limited. There are a number of reasons for this.<br><br>One reason is that Union is a small town. There are not a lot of housing options, and the ones that are available are often expensive. Another reason is that many of the homes in Union are old and in need of repair. This makes them less affordable for families.<br><br>There are a number of programs and organizations that are working to address the issue of affordable housing in Union. The Union Community Development Corporation is one organization that is working to improve the availability of affordable housing in Union. They are working to renovate old homes and to build new ones.<br><br>The Union Public School District is also working to address the issue of affordable housing.

There are a number of factors that contribute to the high cost of living and the lack of availability of affordable housing. However, there are also a number of organizations and programs that are working to improve the situation.<p><h2>The Future of Affordable Housing in Union, Mississippi</h2><p><br><br>There is no doubt that affordable housing is one of the most pressing issues facing Union, Mississippi today. With a median home price of just over $100,000 and a median income of less than $40,000, many residents are finding it difficult to keep up with the rising cost of living. Furthermore, the city has a high poverty rate of 33.8%, which means that a significant portion of the population is struggling to make ends meet.<br><br>In order to address this issue, the city has been working on a number of initiatives to increase the availability of affordable housing. One such initiative is the Union Affordable Housing Trust Fund, which was created in 2016. The trust fund provides financing for the development of new affordable housing units and the rehabilitation of existing units. To date, the trust fund has helped to finance the construction of over 200 new units of affordable housing.<br><br>Another initiative that the city has taken is to waive impact fees for developers who build new affordable housing units. Impact fees are typically charged by the city in order to cover the cost of infrastructure improvements that are required as a result of new development. By waiving these fees, the city is making it more financially viable for developers to build new affordable housing units.<br><br>The city has also created a number of incentives for developers who build mixed-income housing developments. Mixed-income developments are those that include both market-rate and affordable units. These incentives include a density bonus, which allows for a greater number of units to be built on a given parcel of land, and a reduced parking requirement, which can help to lower the overall cost of development.<br><br>The city of Union is committed to increasing the availability of affordable housing and is taking a number of steps to do so. By working with developers and providing financial incentives, the city is making it possible for more residents to have access to safe, affordable housing.<p>
