      <h2>Maynard Affordable Housing Coalition</h2><p><br>The Maynard Affordable Housing Coalition is a group of concerned citizens and community leaders who are committed to ensuring that everyone in Maynard has access to safe, decent, and affordable housing. We believe that everyone deserves a place to call home, and we are working to make that a reality in Maynard.<br><br>We are working to increase the availability of affordable housing in Maynard, and to make sure that the housing that is available is safe and decent. We are also working to educate the community about the importance of affordable housing, and to engage everyone in the fight to ensure that everyone in Maynard has a place to call home.<br><br>If you are concerned about the lack of affordable housing in Maynard, or if you are looking for ways to get involved in the fight for affordable housing, we encourage you to join us. Together, we can make a difference.<p><h2>Maynard's Affordable Housing Trust Fund</h2><p><br>The Maynard's Affordable Housing Trust Fund is a great resource for those who are looking for affordable housing options. The Trust Fund provides a variety of housing options for low- and moderate-income families, including apartments, townhomes, and single-family homes. The Maynard's Affordable Housing Trust Fund is a great way to find safe, affordable housing for your family.<p><h2>Inclusionary Zoning in Maynard</h2><p><br>The Maynard Zoning Bylaw was created in order to protect the town’s character and natural resources while also promoting economic growth. The bylaw includes several different types of zoning, one of which is inclusionary zoning. Inclusionary zoning is a tool that can be used to create more affordable housing in a community.<br><br>Maynard’s inclusionary zoning ordinance was created in order to help the town meet its affordable housing goals. The ordinance requires that all new developments with 10 or more units set aside at least 10% of those units for affordable housing. This means that if a new development has 100 units, at least 10 of those units must be affordable for people who make less than 80% of the area median income.<br><br>The ordinance also includes a “bonus” provision that allows developers to build more units than the minimum if they set aside a larger percentage of units for affordable housing. For example, a developer could choose to set aside 20% of units for affordable housing in order to get a density bonus that would allow them to build more total units.<br><br>The inclusionary zoning ordinance has been successful in creating more affordable housing in Maynard. Since the ordinance was enacted in 2016, there have been several new developments that have included affordable units. These units have helped to increase the town’s inventory of affordable housing and have helped to meet the needs of residents who are looking for an affordable place to live.<p><h2>Maynard's Affordable Housing Plan</h2><p><br>The town of Maynard is currently considering an affordable housing plan that would impact the town in a number of ways. The plan is still in its early stages, but it is already causing quite a bit of controversy.<br><br>The plan would set aside a certain amount of money each year to be used for affordable housing initiatives. This money would come from a variety of sources, including the town's general fund, private donations, and grants.<br><br>The plan would also create a new position within the town government, an "affordable housing coordinator." This person would be responsible for overseeing the implementation of the plan and ensuring that the money is being used effectively.<br><br>Some residents are in favor of the plan, as they believe it is necessary to address the problem of lack of affordable housing in the town. Others are opposed to it, as they believe it will lead to higher taxes and more government involvement in their lives.<br><br>The debate over the affordable housing plan is sure to continue in the coming months, as the town decides whether or not to move forward with it.<p><h2>40B Projects in Maynard</h2><p><br>If you're looking for something to do in Maynard, check out these 40B projects!<br><br>1.

The task force is currently exploring different options and working on a draft plan, which is expected to be completed by the end of the year.<br><br>One of the options the task force is considering is creating a Community Land Trust. This would be a non-profit organization that would purchase and develop land for affordable housing. The land would be leased to qualifying families and individuals, who would then have the opportunity to purchase the homes at below-market rates.<br><br>The task force is also looking at ways to encourage more density in housing developments, which would make it easier for people to find affordable homes. They are also considering providing financial assistance to developers who build affordable housing.<br><br>The task force's goal is to create a plan that will make it easier for people of all income levels to find affordable housing in Maynard. They are hoping to have the plan completed by the end of the year.<p>
