According to the most recent data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the median price for a home in Dublin is $1,056,700, which is out of reach for many Dublin residents.

Another option is to provide financial incentives to developers to build more affordable housing, but this could lead to a decrease in the overall quality of housing in Dublin.<br><br> Ultimately, the decision of how to address the affordable housing crisis in Dublin will need to be made by the city government and the residents of Dublin. There is no easy solution to this complex problem, but it is clear that something needs to be done to address the rising cost of housing in Dublin.<p>
