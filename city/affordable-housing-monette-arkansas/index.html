      <h2> The hidden cost of affordable housing in Monette, Arkansas</h2><p><br>Monette, Arkansas is a small town with a population of just over 1,000 people. It's located in the northeastern corner of the state, about an hour's drive from Memphis, Tennessee. The median household income in Monette is $33,000, and the median home value is $68,000. <br><br>For many years, Monette was a sleepy little town where not much happened. That all changed in 2016, when the town was selected as the site of a new affordable housing development. The development, which is still under construction, will eventually consist of 100 units of affordable housing for low- and moderate-income families. <br><br>The town's residents are divided on the issue of the new development. Some believe that it will bring much-needed economic development to the area. Others worry about the hidden cost of affordable housing. <br><br>One of the main concerns is that the new development will increase traffic in an already congested area. The town's infrastructure is not equipped to handle a significant increase in traffic, and many residents worry that the roads will become even more dangerous. <br><br>Another concern is that the new development will drive up property taxes. Monette has a very low property tax rate, which is one of the main reasons that it's affordable. If the property tax rate goes up, it could price many residents out of their homes. <br><br>The hidden cost of affordable housing is a complex issue, and there is no easy answer. What are your thoughts on the matter?<p><h2> The challenges of providing affordable housing in Monette, Arkansas</h2><p><br>Monette is a small town in northeast Arkansas with a population of just over 1,000 people.

The town has been working with the Arkansas Development finance Authority to create a Tax Increment Financing district that would help fund affordable housing projects. However, the district has not been approved yet.<br><br>In the meantime, the town has been trying to do what it can to help residents find affordable housing. The town has been working with the Northeast Arkansas Regional Housing Authority to provide Section 8 housing vouchers. The town has also been working with the Arkansas Housing and Community Development to provide funding for low-income housing projects.<br><br>The town has made some progress in recent years, but the challenge of providing affordable housing remains.
