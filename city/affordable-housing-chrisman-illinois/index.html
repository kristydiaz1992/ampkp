The population was 1,780 at the 2010 census. The city is the county seat of Edgar County.<br><br>One of the challenges of affordable housing in Chrisman is that the city is located in a rural area. This means that there are not as many housing options available, and that the prices for what is available are often higher than in more urban areas. Additionally, the median household income in Chrisman is relatively low, which can make it difficult for residents to afford housing that is available.<br><br>Another challenge of affordable housing in Chrisman is that the city has a high poverty rate. According to the 2016 American Community Survey, 25.8% of households in Chrisman are considered to be living in poverty. This can make it difficult for residents to find affordable housing, as many landlords and property owners are not willing to rent to those who are considered to be in poverty.<br><br>The challenges of affordable housing in Chrisman are compounded by the fact that the city is located in a rural area. This means that there are fewer resources available to help those who are struggling to find affordable housing. Additionally, there are not as many social service agencies or non-profit organizations located in Chrisman that can help with housing needs.<br><br>The city of Chrisman is working to address the challenges of affordable housing by partnering with the Edgar County Housing Authority. The Housing Authority is working to develop new affordable housing options in Chrisman, and they are also working to provide assistance to those who are struggling to afford their current housing.

In recent years, the issue has only grown more pressing, as the number of people living in poverty has increased and the cost of housing has risen. The lack of affordable housing has had a profound impact on the community, both in terms of the quality of life of its residents and the economic health of the area.<br><br>The most obvious way that the lack of affordable housing affects the Chrisman community is through the quality of life of its residents. Those who cannot find affordable housing are often forced to live in substandard conditions, or even on the street. This can lead to poor health, mental health problems, and crime.

The lack of affordable housing thus has a significant negative impact on the quality of life of Chrisman residents.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing also affects the Chrisman community in terms of its economic health. When people cannot afford housing, they are less likely to spend money in other areas of the economy. This can lead to a decline in businesses and an overall decrease in economic activity.

The lack of affordable housing thus has a significant negative impact on the economic health of the Chrisman.<p><h2>How affordable housing is changing in Chrisman, Illinois</h2><p><br><br>The city of Chrisman, Illinois is seeing a change in its affordable housing landscape. For years, the city has been home to a number of low-income housing developments, but a recent push by city officials to encourage more mixed-income housing is starting to change the city's look.<br><br>In the past, affordable housing in Chrisman has been largely segregated from the rest of the city. Low-income housing developments were often located in isolated areas, making it difficult for residents to access jobs, schools, and other essential services.<br><br>However, city officials are now working to change this by encouraging the development of mixed-income housing. This type of housing includes a mix of market-rate and affordable units, which can help to integrate low-income residents into the wider community.<br><br>The city is also working to improve the quality of its affordable housing stock. In the past, many low-income housing developments were in poor condition and lacked basic amenities. However, the city is now working with developers to create new affordable housing developments that are high-quality and well-maintained.<br><br>These changes are starting to have an impact on the city of Chrisman.
