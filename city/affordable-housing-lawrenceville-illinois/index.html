The town has a population of just over 2,000 people and is located in Lawrence County. The town is situated about 30 miles from the state capital of Springfield and is part of the Springfield metropolitan area. <br><br>The town is somewhat economically depressed, with a median household income of just $30,000. However, the cost of living in Lawrenceville is relatively low. The median home value in the town is just $60,000, and the median rent is just $575 per month. <br><br>Despite its small size and economic challenges, Lawrenceville is a beautiful town. The town is situated on the banks of the Embarras River, and it is surrounded by rolling hills and picturesque farmland. The town also has a rich history. It was founded in 1821, and it is the county seat of Lawrence County. <br><br>One of the most pressing issues facing Lawrenceville is the lack of affordable housing. The town has a very limited supply of housing, and the majority of what is available is either too expensive or in poor condition. This has led to a number of people being forced to live in their cars or on the streets. <br><br>The town has been working to address the affordable housing issue. In 2017, the town received a grant from the Illinois Housing Development Authority to build a new affordable housing development. The development will have 20 units, and it is expected to be completed in 2019. <br><br>The town is also working with a local non-profit to rehabilitate some of the existing housing stock. The hope is that by increasing the supply of affordable housing, the town will be able to attract new businesses and residents. <br><br>The issue of affordable housing is a complex one, and there is no easy solution. However, the town of Lawrenceville is working hard to find a way to address the issue.<p><h2> The Challenges of Affordable Housing in Lawrenceville, Illinois</h2><p><br><br><br>There is a severe shortage of affordable housing in Lawrenceville, Illinois. The waiting list for Section 8 housing assistance is over 1,000 families long, and there are only enough units available to help about one-third of those families. The median rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Lawrenceville is $787, and the median income for a family of four is only $24,000. This means that a family would have to spend at least three-quarters of their income on housing, which is not feasible for most families.<br><br>There are a number of reasons for the lack of affordable housing in Lawrenceville. The city has experienced a population boom in recent years, but the housing stock has not kept pace with the demand. In addition, many of the city's older homes are in need of repair and are not up to code. The city has also been slow to approve new construction projects.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing is a major problem for Lawrenceville. It is difficult for families to find decent housing that they can afford, and many are forced to live in substandard conditions. The city needs to take action to address the affordable housing crisis.<p>
