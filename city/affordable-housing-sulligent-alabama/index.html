This can help to create a sense of stability and community pride.<br><br>Another benefit of affordable housing is that it can create jobs.

And, of the individuals, 54 percent were unsheltered, meaning they were living on the streets, in abandoned buildings, or other places not intended for human habitation.<br><br>Most people experiencing homelessness are concentrated in major metropolitan areas like New York City or Los Angeles.
