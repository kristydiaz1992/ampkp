The population of Murrieta was 103,466 at the 2010 census. Murrieta experienced a 133.7% population increase between 2000 and 2010, according to the most recent census. This trend is expected to continue as the city's population is projected to reach 200,000 by 2025.<br><br>One of the biggest challenges facing Murrieta is the lack of affordable housing. This is an issue that impacts families and individuals of all income levels and can have a ripple effect throughout the entire community.<br><br>The high cost of housing is often cited as a major reason why people are struggling to make ends meet. In fact, a recent report found that almost half of all Californians are struggling to afford their housing.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing not only impacts families who are struggling to pay their rent or mortgage, but it also has a ripple effect on the entire community. When people are forced to spend a large portion of their income on housing, they have less money to spend on other essentials like food, clothing, and healthcare. This can lead to increased poverty and crime rates and can put a strain on city resources.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing is also a major barrier to economic mobility. Families who are barely scraping by are unlikely to have the savings or income to make a move to a better neighborhood or school district. This lack of mobility can perpetuate the cycle of poverty and prevent families from achieving their full potential.<br><br>Murrieta has taken some steps to address the lack of affordable housing in the city, but more needs to be done. The city has created a Housing Commission and has adopted an inclusionary housing ordinance, but these measures alone are not enough.<br><br>The city needs to do more to incentivize developers to build more affordable housing and to make it easier for families to access affordable housing. The city also needs to invest in programs that help families with the high cost of housing.<br><br>The lack of affordable housing is a complex problem that requires a multifaceted solution. The city of Murrieta is taking some steps in the right direction, but more needs to be done to address this critical issue.<p>
