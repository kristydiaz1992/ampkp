This could include more funding for programs like the Low Income Housing Tax Credit, which provides tax breaks to developers who build or rehabilitate affordable housing.<br><br>Another solution is to create incentives for developers to build more affordable housing. This could include offering tax breaks or other financial incentives for developers who include a certain percentage of affordable units in their projects.<br><br>Another solution is to require that all new developments include a certain percentage of affordable units. This could be done through inclusionary zoning ordinances, which would mandate that a certain percentage of units in new developments be set aside for low- and moderate-income households.<br><br>Finally, it is also important to create more affordable housing options through public-private partnerships. This could involve partnering with developers to create mixed-income developments or partnering with private landlords to create rent-subsidized housing.<br><br>Each of these solutions has the potential to make a difference in the lives of working families struggling to afford housing in Justice, Illinois. It is important to work with state and local leaders to find the right mix of solutions for the community.<p>
