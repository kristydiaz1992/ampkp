      <h2> The current state of affordable housing in Winona, Minnesota.</h2><p><br>The median rent for a one-bedroom apartment in Winona is $653, which is relatively affordable compared to other parts of the country. The vacancy rate for apartments is also low, at only 2.3%.<br><br>However, the availability of affordable housing is still a problem in Winona. According to the most recent data from the U.S. Census Bureau, over 30% of households in Winona are considered “cost-burdened,” meaning they spend more than 30% of their income on housing.<br><br>There are a number of reasons why the availability of affordable housing is an issue in Winona. One reason is that the city’s population has grown faster than the number of new housing units being built. In the last five years, the population of Winona has increased by 2.5%, while the number of new housing units has only increased by 1.7%.<br><br>Another reason why affordable housing is an issue in Winona is that wages have not kept pace with the cost of living. The median household income in Winona is $48,711, which is about $10,000 less than the median income for the state of Minnesota as a whole.<br><br>There are a number of initiatives underway to try to improve the availability of affordable housing in Winona. The city is currently working on a new Comprehensive Plan that includes a goal of increasing the production of new housing units by 3% per year.
