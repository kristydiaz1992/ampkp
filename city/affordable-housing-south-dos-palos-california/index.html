This leaves very little room for residents to save money or live comfortably.<br><br>There are a few affordable housing options available in South Dos Palos, but they are far from perfect. For example, there is an apartment complex that offers units for $800 per month, but the complex is located in a high-crime area.

For example, a development may include some units that are reserved for low-income residents, while others are available at market rates. This mix of housing types can help create a more diverse and inclusive community.<br><br>The third principle is to carefully consider the impact of new development on existing residents. When planning new affordable housing developments, it is important to take into account the needs of existing residents, and to ensure that the new development will not displace them.
