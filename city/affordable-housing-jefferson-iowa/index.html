However, there are some creative ways to help afford housing. One option is to live in a mobile home.

This may not be the most comfortable option, but it can save money on rent or a mortgage.<br><br>Another option is to house share with another family. This can be a great way to split the cost of housing and also get some extra support around the house. Lastly, consider looking for housing outside of Jefferson. There are many small towns and rural areas that offer more affordable housing options.

With the city's population continuing to grow, the demand for housing is outpacing the supply, which is driving up prices.<br><br>For many years, Jefferson was known as a "bedroom community," where people would live and work in the city but commute to larger cities for their jobs.

More and more businesses are choosing to locate in Jefferson, which is creating more jobs in the city.<br><br>As the job market in Jefferson continues to grow, so does the demand for housing. Unfortunately, the supply of affordable housing is not keeping up with the demand.
