The average rent for an apartment in San Francisco is now over $4,000, and even in relatively affordable cities like Oakland and San Jose, rents are now well over $2,000. For many people who work in the Bay Area, these prices are simply not affordable.<br><br>This is especially true for service industry workers, who often work long hours for relatively low wages. For these workers, finding affordable housing can be a real challenge.<br><br>One city that is feeling the squeeze of the Bay Area's housing crisis is Belmont. Located in the heart of the Silicon Valley, Belmont is home to a number of tech companies and start-ups. The city is also home to a number of service industry workers who work in these companies.<br><br>Due to the high cost of living in the Bay Area, many of these workers are finding it difficult to find affordable housing in Belmont.

For example, the city could provide funding for repairs and maintenance of existing affordable housing units.<br><br>The bottom line is that the city of Belmont needs to do more to address its affordable housing crisis. By working with developers to create more affordable housing units, and by supporting its existing affordable housing stock, the city can make a real difference for its residents.<p>
