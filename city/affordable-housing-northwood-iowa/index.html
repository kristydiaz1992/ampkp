      <h2>Northwood, Iowa's affordable housing crisis</h2><p><br>Northwood, Iowa is facing an affordable housing crisis. The town has a median home value of $129,000, but the median rent is $775. That means that a family earning the median income of $52,000 would have to spend more than 30% of their income on housing.<br><br>There are a number of factors that have contributed to the housing crisis in Northwood. The town has seen a influx of new residents in recent years, but the number of new homes being built has not kept pace. This has led to increased competition for rentals and higher prices.<br><br>The town's location also makes it difficult to find affordable housing. Northwood is situated in a rural area, so there are few apartments or duplexes available. The nearest city with more housing options, Mason City, is more than an hour away.<br><br>The housing crisis in Northwood is having a ripple effect on the town's economy. Businesses are struggling to attract and retain employees, and families are being forced to move out of town in search of more affordable housing.<br><br>The town's leaders are aware of the problem and are working on a plan to address it. In the meantime, there are a few things that residents can do to help ease the housing crisis.<br><br>If you're looking for a place to live in Northwood, consider renting an apartment or duplex instead of a house. This will help to ease the demand for rental homes and put downward pressure on prices.<br><br>You can also help by supporting businesses that are struggling to find employees.
