      <h2>Construction begins on new affordable housing development in Saint Louis Park</h2><p><br>Construction is underway on a new affordable housing development in Saint Louis Park. The development, located at the corner of Minnetonka Boulevard and Louisiana Avenue, will feature 48 units of affordable housing for families and individuals.<br><br>The development is a joint effort between the City of Saint Louis Park, the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency, and CommonBond Communities, a nonprofit affordable housing provider. CommonBond will manage and operate the development.<br><br>The City of Saint Louis Park is providing $3.5 million in financing for the project, which will be repaid through the sale of tax-exempt bonds. The Minnesota Housing Finance Agency is providing $5.5 million in low-income housing tax credits, which will generate approximately $4.5 million in equity for the project.<br><br>The total development cost is estimated at $13.5 million. Construction is expected to be completed in late 2019.<p><h2>Saint Louis Park officials unveil new affordable housing plan</h2><p><br>St. Louis Park officials have unveiled a new affordable housing plan that would create more than 200 units of affordable housing over the next five years.<br><br>The plan, which was presented to the city council on Monday night, would create a mix of rental and homeownership opportunities for low- and moderate-income households.<br><br>The city would use a combination of city-owned land, federal and state funding, and private investment to create the housing.<br><br>The plan is still in the early stages, and officials say they will continue to refine it as they seek input from the community.<p><h2>Affordable housing crisis in Saint Louis Park reaches breaking point</h2><p><br>It’s no secret that the cost of housing is rising rapidly in the Twin Cities, and Saint Louis Park is no exception. In fact, the city’s affordable housing crisis has reached a breaking point.<br><br>Rents in Saint Louis Park have increased by double digits in recent years, while incomes have remained relatively stagnant. As a result, an increasing number of residents are finding it difficult to make ends meet.<br><br>In an effort to address the problem, the city has been working to create more affordable housing options. However, progress has been slow due to a lack of funding.<br><br>The situation has become so dire that some residents are being forced to move out of the city altogether. This is not only a loss for the city, but also for the businesses and organizations that rely on these residents’ support.<br><br>It’s time for the city to take action and find a way to address the affordable housing crisis before it’s too late.<p><h2>Mayor calls for action on affordable housing in Saint Louis Park</h2><p><br>As the cost of housing continues to rise in the Twin Cities, Saint Louis Park Mayor Jake Spano is calling on state and local leaders to take action to ensure that affordable housing is available for all residents.<br><br>In a recent op-ed in the Star Tribune, Mayor Spano urged state lawmakers to pass legislation that would create a dedicated funding stream for affordable housing. He also called on the city of Saint Louis Park to do its part by using its land and zoning regulations to encourage the development of more affordable housing.<br><br>"We need to do everything we can to ensure that everyone who wants to live in Saint Louis Park can afford to do so," Mayor Spano wrote. "That means taking action to create more affordable housing options."<br><br>Mayor Spano's op-ed comes as the city of Saint Louis Park is considering a new comprehensive plan that would guide future development in the city. The draft plan includes several recommendations for how the city can promote the development of more affordable housing, including by allowing for denser development in some areas and by creating new incentives for developers to include affordable units in their projects.<br><br>The Saint Louis Park City Council is expected to vote on the draft comprehensive plan later this month.<p><h2>Alderman proposes innovative solution to affordable housing crisis in Saint Louis Park</h2><p><br><br>Alderman Joe Anderson is proposing an innovative solution to the affordable housing crisis in Saint Louis Park. Anderson's proposal would create a Community Land Trust, which would be a nonprofit entity that would purchase and manage affordable housing units in the city. The Land Trust would work with the city to identify properties that could be converted into affordable housing, and would then purchase those properties and lease them to low- and moderate-income residents.<br><br>The Land Trust model has been successful in other cities, and Anderson believes it could be a viable solution to the affordable housing crisis in Saint Louis Park. The city is currently facing a shortage of affordable housing, and many residents are being priced out of the market. The Land Trust would help to create more affordable housing options for residents, and would also help to stabilize the housing market in the city.<br><br>The proposal is still in the early stages, and the details are still being worked out. However, Anderson is confident that the Land Trust model could be a successful way to address the affordable housing crisis in Saint Louis Park.<p>
